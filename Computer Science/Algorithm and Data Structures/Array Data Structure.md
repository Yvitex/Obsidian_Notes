# Arrays
Arrays have 4 main methods which function as insertion(), deletion(), lookup(), and push()/pop()
Here we will use [[Javascript]] as an example
- [[Array Push() + Pop()]] 
- [[Array Lookup()]]
- [[Array Deletion() + Insertion()]]


There are 2 kinds of array:
- [[Static Arrays]]
- [[Dynamic Arrays]]

| Methods   | Time Complexity                   | Reliability                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Push      | [[Constant Time\|O(1)]]           | Can be [[Linear  Time Complexity\|O(n)]] |
| Pop       | [[Constant Time\|O(1)]]           | Can be [[Linear  Time Complexity\|O(n)]] |
| Lookup    | [[Constant Time\|O(1)]]           |                                          |
| Deletion  | [[Linear  Time Complexity\|O(n)]] |                                          |
| Insertion | [[Linear  Time Complexity\|O(n)]] |                                          |
| Search    |      [[Linear  Time Complexity\|O(n)]]                             |                                          |

To understand this more, we could practice in [[Creating Array DS from Scratch]]

## Pros:
When to use
- fast lookup
- fast push and pop
- ordered meaning it is fast as [[Memory address]]es are near at each other. 

## Cons
- Slow Insertion and Deletion as it needs to shift the rest of an arrays
