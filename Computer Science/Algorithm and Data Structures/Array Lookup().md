# Array Lookup
A very simple method used to look data from an index. We simply need to know the index
```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

numbers[0] // O(1)
```

Basically, this have the time complexity of [[Constant Time|O(1)]] as the [[Memory Controller]] already have direct address to the [[Memory address]] of the [[Random Access Memory|ram]] where it is stored.
