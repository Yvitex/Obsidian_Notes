# Bellman Ford Algorithm
This [[Searching Algorithm|Graph Traversal]] algoritm is the same function as [[Dijkstra Algorithm]] but also works if the graph have negative weights. 

![[Pasted image 20221012035411.png]]


Compared to the [[Big O Asymptotic Analysis|Time Complexity]] of [[Dijkstra Algorithm]], this algorithm will take a long time to calculate having [[Quadratic Time|O(n^2)]] in the equation as the worse case. Only use this algorithm if we have negative weights, use [[Dijkstra Algorithm]] for graph that has non negative weights, and use [[Breadth First Search]] for values that have no weights.
