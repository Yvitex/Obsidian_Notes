# Coding Interview Guide
The first thing to remember that in an interview, this is not your only chance to succeed. Every failure is a learning opportuninty, develop your self from failure cause it will occur, it would and deal with that is life. 

Also, don't be so gloomy. Touch grass. Be excited and sniff some weed if you must. Interview is not just about the interviewee but also the interviewer. 

Interviewer want to ask this 3 questions:
- Can you do the job?: Ask about how technical you are
- Can I work with you?: Ask about how social you are
- Are you going to improve?: Ask if you are willing to learn

To answer these questions, create 4 stories that demonstrate:
- Technicality: a story about your skills, stack. What big project did we create?
- Success: a story about success, like about your award winning app or you graduate as a suma cum yamete
- Leadership: a story where you takes charge of a group.
- Challenge: a story where you overcome a very difficult problem.

Specifically, interviewers always ask: "Tell me about yourself?"
You must answer with the following points in mind:
- Trigger of succes
- Mention thing you want to get asked
- Skill relevant to the job

We may tell them a story of how we are a shit ass no skilled talentless bastard at first and became a person knowledgeable today. KEep in mind that the interviewer don't know about your resume. Tell them about something difficult you did and how you solve that problem, the projects you built and what strategy and programming languages did you use, did you optimize it? Did you learn from it? How will this story make you standout from the rest of applicants? We want to tell this story along with 4 factors said above: (t, s, l, c), we could start with "I got really interested in coding when..."

"Why us?"
To answer this question, show them that they are special. To answer this, research about their past problem and use them that you are familiar with them, and you want to know more and learn how to solve or how you could solve the problem. Use the the 4 factors. 

"Tell me about the problem you have solved?"
To answer this question, we use the format of SAR, Situtaiton, action and result. What is the problem? what are the actions we take? What are the result? Giving result through numerical basis like 40% etc are quite good compared to just saying its improved. The problem we are doing directs upon the scalability, performance and security. 

"Tell me about your weakness?"
Do not answer something cringey, like, "I care too much". For fuc sake, shove that dick to yer face nigga. Tell them your real weakness and how you overcame it, technically speaking. Like how I don't think first before I write a program, or when there is hard problem I tend to sleep instead. And show them your solution like writing pseudocode and structuring, researching intensively diving straight into the problem without worrying, documenting my past solutions so that I won't be tough the next time around.

"Do you have some question for us?"
Talk about them, if you have a question, get the answer through their name. 
- What is the greatest mistake you made in the first month of the job and what you did you do?
- Where do you see this company going for the next 4 or 5 years?
- Why did you join this company?
- Have you seen your skills grow in the past year?
- What is the one time that you messed up and how did the company handle it?
- What did you wish to know before starting the job at this company?


Secret weapon: When talking to interviewers, their are certain things to keep in mind
- Simplicity over compelxity: do not over complicate things, simple code is beautiful. Simple solution is the best because we need to convey our codes understandable to many
- PRemature optimization is the root of all evil: optimization is good but don't get to obsessed with it. We need to consider time and resources.
- Over all goal, not myopic: Solving a problem is good but we also need to consider external factors such as time and limitations
- Don't complain to clients/ codes: nobody wants to work to someone like this.
- No ego: You are on a team, don't take pride of your code but rather take constructuve criticism as a way to grow.

Negotioantion:
For instance you have accepted to a job, negotiate:
- Always give reason: explain why you can't accept the offer or you want a raise
- BE positive: Thank them for the offter
- Don't end the conversation: if they ask you about you expected salary, start with the average salary in the industry
- Always negotiate: this will make a difference in your pay
- Have stakes: make them believe that you are not desparate, and you will lose nothing by rejecting the offer. Take the risk
- Ask for more time: Explain the reason why, comapre the offers from different companies.
