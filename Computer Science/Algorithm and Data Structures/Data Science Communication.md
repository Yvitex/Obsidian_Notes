# Communication
One of the most hardest problem when it comes to [[Data Science]]

The first question we may ask to ourselves is *who is it for?* and this could be broken down into 3 question
- What question will they have?
- What concerns can you address before they arise?
- What needs do they have?

If its your workmates that have similar minds like you, then you might just shove technical stuff into the conversation like it's nothing, but if not for example is the client, you don't want to do that. You must think like they do and have a mutual ground.  

- what question will they have or what is that they need to know?
For bosses, project manager, seniors, we could notify them about our hurdles, or what problems did we encounter when doing our task. They are responsible for the projects's smooth sail in accordance to budget and time.

For teammates, when working on a project withing a huge timescale. for example 6 months. we could break it down to a month and this month broken down into days.

We want to communicate our work to our team mates, and how we will do this, we could do using the following outline

- What I worked on Today
	- What's working?
	- What's not working?
	- What could be improved?
- What I am working on Next?
	- What's your next course of action?
	- Why?
	- What's holding you back?

Take not of overlaps or which of the questions arrive thrice? Also you might also communicate this on the senior

some things may seems interesting to others but might be obvious to you. differnt people have different interest and when they show it, entertain it. if you can't just simply say I don't know but I'll look into it and get back to you.
