# Dijkstra Algorithm
Is a kind of [[Searching Algorithm|Graph Traversal]] algoritm to find the shortest path possible just like [[Breadth First Search]]. Yes, the one thing that is special about this algorithm is that it will consider the weights of the edges in the calculation of the shortest path. 

I mean, in google map, to find the shortest path, we just don;t consider the amount of nodes that we will traverse into but rather we also care about the distance of the nodes, how frequent are traffics are and a lot of other factors, and that will contribute to the weight of the edges.

The problem here is that it doesn't consider negative weights. For this case, we could use [[Bellman Ford Algorithm]].
