# Exponential Time Complexity
This is the inverse of [[Logarithmic Time Complexity]], where in as the number of items or the index increase, the number of iteration significantly increase or even doubles. For example our n = 5, our iterations could be 50, but when we increase it to n = 20, it could be 100000.

The nest example where this might occur is in [[Recursion]].
