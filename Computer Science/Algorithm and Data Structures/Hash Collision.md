# Hash Collision
Happens that causes an overlaying data in a [[Memory address]] or container. So when we try a [[Hashmap Lookup]], it will become a [[Linear  Time Complexity|O(n)]] as it needs to loop in the cell to fetch the data that we want.

This occurs because the [[Hashing Function]] of the progamming languge is faulty creating the same hash for the keys therefore occupying the same memory space
