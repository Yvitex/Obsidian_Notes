# Javascript Object
Is a atype of [[Hash Table]] that stores a key value pair in [[Javascript]]

```js
let obj = {
	key: "value"
}
```


We could also use `Map()` method that stores any kind of data type as their keys
```js
const a = new Map()
```


And `Set()` method that only stores the key
```js
const b = new Set()
```
