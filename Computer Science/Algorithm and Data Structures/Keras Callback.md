# Keras callback
Is a way to create a mangeable visualization that will display our progress  and stops the training od the [[Machine Learning Algoritm|model]] when there is no improvement anymore prevent our model to train for too long and become [[Overfitting]]

We use the following callbacks
- [[Keras Tensorboard Callback]] - for visualization
- [[Keras EarlyStopping Callback]] - for early stopping
