# O(n)
Linear time is the most commonly used  [[Big O Asymptotic Analysis]] and oftenly occuring when looping an array. When an item of an array increases, the number of operation inside the loop also increases creating a [[Linearity]] between 2 variables. They are directly proportional to each other.

Imagine a factorry of box compresion with only one machine. The machine will run through collecting the boxes one by one and compressing them in the process, if there are a lot of box, the machine will take longer to finish but if there is only one then the machine will quickly finish.

If there is 1 element to be performed, then it is [[Constant Time|O(1)]], if there is 1000, then it is O(1000)
