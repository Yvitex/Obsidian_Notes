# Logarithmic Time Complexity
This is a time complexity where in as the number of items increase, the number of iterations are significantly reduced. Like for example when we have 5 items, we may only need to traverse in 3 step, but with 10000 items, we may need to traverse in 20 steps. 

Meaning this is better than [[Linear  Time Complexity|O(n)]]
