# Loglinear Time Complexity
This [[Big O Asymptotic Analysis|Time Complexity]] is produce when using [[Divide and Conquer]] approach plus [[Linear  Time Complexity]] specially in [[Sorting Algorithm]].

O(log n) is just a combination of [[Linear  Time Complexity|O(n)]] and [[Logarithmic Time Complexity|O(log n)]]. For example, in searching algorithm like [[Merge Sort]]. We divide the [[Array Data Structure]] using a [[Divide and Conquer]] approach which causes [[Logarithmic Time Complexity|O(log n)]] then we do another operation that will merge the array into one which causes [[Linear  Time Complexity|O(n)]]. In this case we multiplied both opertation causing [[Loglinear Time Complexity|O(n log(n))]].
