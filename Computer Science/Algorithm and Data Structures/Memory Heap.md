# Heap
Is where we store some variables. This is a part of [[Random Access Memory]]

When we assign a value to a variable, we are storing that calue to the memory heap
```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
```

We are not using this variable, and because of that we are using the heap for useless data, this is called Memory leak.
