# Priority Queues
Are not like [[Queue]] but more like a [[Binary Heap]] where their is a priority. At first, it is done in first come first serve or [[Queue|FIFO]] but when higher priority nodes or values come, then they are served first because they are more important. 

For example, in a  night club, when VIPs arrive, then they are served first because they pay more than local folks.

Sp if we have this kind of [[Data Structure]] in an airplane, the captain of course are served first before the passenger, if we add the flight attendant, then they are served first before the passenger and they are inserted from left to right so we change the left passenger by the attendant and descend the passenger below.![[Pasted image 20221005030457.png]]
Here is the implmentattion for this kind of [data structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-priority-queue-javascript/)
