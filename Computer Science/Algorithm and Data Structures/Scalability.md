# Scalability
Scalability comes with 2 parts and they are:
- The speed or how fast is the [[Runtime]] is measured in [[Big O Asymptotic Analysis|time complexity]]
- The memory or how much storage the program occupies measured in [[Space Complexity]]


This 2 have a trade off meaning when we want a faster program, we sacrifice some memory. And vice versa

Measured Using the [[Big O Asymptotic Analysis]] analysis
