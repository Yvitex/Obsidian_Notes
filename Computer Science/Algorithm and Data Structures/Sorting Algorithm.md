# Sorting Algorithms
Why can't we just use `.sort()` for dog sake really? It's good for small data, yes, it's fine but when it comes to larger set of data and [[Databases|database]]s, then you're fucked. There are many sorting algorithm that is available for us and it is divided into 2 Categories:

## Comparison Sort
- [[Insertion Sort]]
- [[Selection Sort]]
- [[Bubble Sort]]
- [[Shell Sort]]
- [[Merge Sort]]
- [[Heap Sort]]
- [[Quick Sort]]

## Non-Comparison Sort
- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort

Non comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that doesn't compare items in the array but rather take advantage of how they are stored in memory. Though this is only limited to integers, no float, no string and also they are limited in scope and inflexible. For Example Radix sort does not support floats but only [[Fixed Length Integers]]

Different sorting algorithm have different specialties and speed which we could see using this [website](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
