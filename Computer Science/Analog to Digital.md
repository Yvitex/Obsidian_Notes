Are electrical signals.
Analog tech - uses electrical pulses of varying amplitude, a continuous value
Digital tech - uses information translated into  [[Binary]] format representing the amplitude

Analog recording perfectly captures the wave while digital recording converts first the wave into binary and store it to a digital device. 

Human voice, sounds etc are naturally [[Analog Signal]]s and when these signals are need to be transfered over a long distance, the use of cables or wires are necessary.

However, the use of analog signals causes distortion, interference and data breach or losses. Overtime, the trends in the use of Digital signals became necessary to produce a more accurate representation of data transferable over a long distance.
