Pretty much everything that we see on the screen of an application is a `view`. I mean they all inherit the view class as the parent class. There is also a heirarchy to understand this [[Java OOP Inheritance]].

The ViewGroup, TextView and ImageView directly inherits from the view class. The text view have children called Button and Edit text while the viewgroup which is simple a group of views or collection of views have children which are called [[LinearLayout]], FrameLayout, ContraintLayout. [[ScrollView]] inherit from FrameLayout
