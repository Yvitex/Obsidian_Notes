This is a very important part of android development where it contains the user permission, backups and activity of the application. ![[Pasted image 20221019060201.png]]

We could set the `allowBackup` to false to make it have no backup, this also contains the icon and labels as well as themes. Inside the activity tag, contains the main execution  and th launcher when we open the app. These are generated automatically.
