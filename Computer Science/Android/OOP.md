# Object Oriented Programming
The main objective of OOP is reusability, readability and simplicity. I think?

OOP uses what we called classes which is the blueprint to create any number of intances called objects. Imagine a factory, you create a blueprint, the factory could manufacture your blueprint any number of times but still inheriting the characteristic or functionaility in the blueprint. 

This characteristic is caleld attributes, those functionality are called methods

Attributes can be any numerical value, string or another object.  Methods are functions that do something. For example, we have a car blueprint, is it color red? blue? Does it have a roof? how many seats does it have? Now, what methods could it have? `startEngine()`, `runVehicle()`, `turnOnSideLights()`
