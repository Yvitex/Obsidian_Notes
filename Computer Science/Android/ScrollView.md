This is used if the other view componetn overflows and you want it to be seen in the UI. To enable this in [[Android Studio]] we could search in the UI component section and find `ScrollView`

Drag and drop to the screen. Open the tree component and we could see that this scroll view already have a [[LinearLayout]] embedded to it. ![[Pasted image 20221021093801.png]]

Since, if we only want to use a single view component, we don't need it. Delete it. Drag and drop a TextView and make sure it is inside the ScrollView
