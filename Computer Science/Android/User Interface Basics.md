# XML Creation
I just noticed, but isn't Java a name of a rice?![[Pasted image 20220616034109.png]]

Actually, nevermind. I'm just getting hungry. The tools we are going to use for this tutorial is called [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
So please download it. Make sure you enable the simulation feature i dunno. After all is well and done. We could now start creating our very first application by simply creating a blank activity in the phone section

Next stop is the need to specify an API level for android. It seems this is quite different from this [[API]]. The API level indicates the latest version of android which means, the higher the level, the lower rate of compatibility it has to overall ratio of phone so *make sure to choose lower API first as a beginner*

API 21 can run unto 98.6% of devices and for now, we are using the programming language called [[JAVA]] , no, not the rice. After we create this file, we could see 2 tabs loaded on the screen. One is a [[.XML]] file and a [[JAVA]] file.

Inside the [[.XML]], this is what we will stumble upon

A blue print for our User Interface, where we could add widgets such as button, text and the likes. Pressing one of this widgets enable us to see the constraint it have that dictates its position in relation to other widgets

We could change the text, sizes and other attributes of the widget in the right section

We could create  a widget in the palette section. Jimy drag and drop the widget of your choosing, edit it in the attribute tabs to match your liking.

But simply doing so was not enough

We need to contraint it or else it will reposition itself to the top left corner when we run the program. To constrain it, just drag and drp the white balls in the four sides of the widget. ![[Pasted image 20220616040953.png]]

We could do the same in other Widgets, we could specify the distance or spacing from constrains to other widget. But, this looks terrible, wanna know how to make the button functionable? Then you need to learn the [[Java Basics|basics of java]]
