Now, we have a new set of folders in our LibraryName, inside **MyClass** file, we will see this starting code
```
package com.example.learnjava;  
  
public class MyClass {  
}
```

We could finish the setup by creating a **Main method** inside of MyClass.
```
package com.example.learnjava;  
  
public class MyClass {  
	public static void main(String[] args){
	
	}
}
```

The shortcut for this is just typing main, then enter. This won't work if power saving is on. Now, we could try and print out "Hello World" to the console

```
package com.example.learnjava;  
  
public class MyClass {  
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
```

The shortcut shall be typing *sout* then enter. Before running this, we should make sure that the class is running and not the app, to do that, we should press the run button inside the source code
