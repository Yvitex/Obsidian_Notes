We main notice this code in our `MainActivity.java` code. `setContentView` simply takes an argument which is an [[Android Studio|xml]] file and show it as the user interface for the user. `R.layout.activity_main` is the [[Android Studio|xml]] to show which is what we are designing all along

We could create our own [[Android Studio|xml]] and make it so that it would be revealed in the user interface.
