## Basic Setup
Every starting file, or in case of arduino, the scratch is supposed to have 2 main functions. Similar to how game works, we have a `void setup` function and `void loop` function
```cpp
void setup(){

}

void loop(){

}
```

The thing is, codes inside the setup will be executed once, while inside the loop, it will be executed infinitely in a loop.

Deleting either one of this function may bring destruction to the compiler-kind
