There are several types of sizes we could pich in a bread board. 
Each breadboard are composed of horizontal metal connection

So the connection flows horirontally and each columns are isolated from each other. ![[Pasted image 20220625061824.png]]

For example

The image shows 2 wire hacing no [[Electric Circuit|electrical]] connection or whatever but we could apply another jumper wire to establish a connection between the 2

The medium sized bread board in the other hand have some vertical connection in the [[Voltage Relationships in BJT|Vcc]] and [[ground]] part

There we could applu the possitive and negative source and easily charge the horizontal with it. Such is an example
