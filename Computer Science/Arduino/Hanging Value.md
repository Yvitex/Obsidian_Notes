# Hanging Value
Happens when the state of the [[Digital Pins]] are not defined or not specific (if it is high(connected to [[Voltage Relationships in BJT|VCC]]) or low(connected to the [[Ground]])). It is similar to an [[2 Extreme Scenarios of a Circuit|Open Circuit]], simple circuits though doesn;t need to detect the [[Electric Current|Current]] all the time unlike [[Digital Pins]] that needs to read wether a state is high or low. 


The common example is a circuit from a digital pin with a button to the [[Ground]].![[Drawing 2022-06-21 11.18.20.excalidraw.png]]
I mean... huh? Air is an [[Insulator]] with a great amount of [[Resistance]] right, then it must have 0v, and 0v is specification creadible to the range of low? So event if we press the button conencting the circuit to the [[Ground]], the state will still become low which does not change anything at all!!!!


Another name for it is *floating value*.  When a circuit is created, it is usually connected to a [[Ground]], when the connection to the  [[Ground ]]does not exist, therefore it is *floating voltage*
