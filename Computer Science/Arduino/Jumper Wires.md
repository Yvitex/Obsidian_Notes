# Jumper Wires
Jumper wires are wires applied into a [[Breadboard]] to create a circuit connection of [[Electricity]]. There are several types of jumper wires we could use in prototyping.

## Male to Male

They are wires with metallic endings, widely used in [[Arduino]]'s header and breadboard. 

## Female to Female

Female to female are wires without metallic ending.
