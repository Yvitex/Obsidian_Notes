# Pull Up or Pull Down Resistor
These are used to prevent a [[Hanging Value]] in the [[Digital Pins]]. 

## It is pull up when
The resistor is connected to the [[Voltage Relationships in BJT|voltage source]]  or high [[voltage]]. This is much more common than pull down and it functions to cut the current connected to the high voltage when a circuit [[2 Extreme Scenarios of a Circuit|is closed]] by a button connected to a low voltage. These [[Resistors]] are usually high in value to produce the effect. 

## It is pull down when
The resustor is connected to the [[Ground]], Works in the same principle as pull up
