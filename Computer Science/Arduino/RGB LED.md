A tyle of [[led]] with different colors, red green and blue. ![[Pasted image 20220701120228.png]]

The construction in making those is that it is only a cobination of 3 different [[Diode]]s with common cathode or pin that we connect to the [[Ground]]

So to light he red diode, we apply 5 [[Voltage]] to the red anode then to the common cathode. The same is true for green and blue.
