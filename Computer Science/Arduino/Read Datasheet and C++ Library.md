# Data sheet and Library
Datasheets provide information about a device, typically not known by the user until they pick the data sheet up and read it thoroughly. These are where typically we fetch information and create a library using those information

One f the most important part of datasheets are the graphs

We could see the [[Linearity]] between each relationship

## Library
Here is another example from [[MCP9808]] found on [[Github]] at [this](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MCP9808_Library) url

We could see every functionality in `.h` file which we know is the one we import to the source code.

This contain every methods we could use. The implementation or algorithm could be found at `.cpp`
