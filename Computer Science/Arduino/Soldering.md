# Soldering Job For Arduino
First of all, we need to apply the pin to the component and place it to the holder. If there is an excess in pins, you are free to cut it, then place it to a holder for soldering such as [[Breadboard]]

Remember that the breadboard is a plastic material with metals inside. While soldering, the surface might melt so becareful. 

Next is to touch the pin with the tip of the [[Solder Tin]] and the other side by the soldering iron. We do this rather than melting the solder tin directly to ensure that the pins are also heated evenly and prevent a cold joint. In this case, we melt the solder with the heat of the pin.

If you fucked up, we can always use the solder pump to such the excess  solder out. first is to melt the solder and then hold the pump sucker and when it is already liquefied, press the button and voila, eureka, bien sur, mademoiselle.
