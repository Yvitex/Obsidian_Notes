## Perosity

Porosity = generosity + intimacy. 
Generosity starts when you say "How can I help you? (Paano kita matutulungan?)". Look for a way to help with other people and it will slowly build a relation with this people. We serve people without expecting a return, don't turn generosity into transaction.

This generosity scheme could be seen as a pyramid. The baseline or the most basic value is the universal currency where we offer compliment and praise, admiration to other people that makes them want to befriend us. 

Professional currency is when you are offering a service of extraordinary quality. 
Personal currency is where you help other on a personal problem, like their children, their health etc.

Intimacy is a connection of a deeper level, this starts when you ask "How's it goin? What's going on with you life?"
