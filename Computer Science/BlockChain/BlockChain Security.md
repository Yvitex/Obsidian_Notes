# How Secure is the Blockchain?

To Hijack or tampers this system, you need a very powerful supercomputer that could compete against 51% of the [[Blockchain Nodes|nodes]] to recalculate the past histories and any other transaction in the whole network.

In actuality, we might... read about [[Sybil Attack]]

Further more, this system utilize a [[Hashing Function]] in a chain of [[Blocks of Blockchain|blocks]] 

## Authentication Structure
The blockchain authentication have 2 main components
1. Public key - username/ responsible for recognizing the user
2. Private key - password/ responsible for authenticating if the user is the legal user

This structure is basically called [[Asymmetric Cryptography]] 


## Solution Algorithm
When miners solved the [[Hashing Function]] quickly, less than 10 min, then they increase the complexity of [[Cryptography|cryptograhic]] problem, when greater than, then they make things more easier.  Read about [[Miners]]

When there is a disrepancy in the [[Reaching Consensus|consensus]] of transaction, it is always the longest chain wins.
