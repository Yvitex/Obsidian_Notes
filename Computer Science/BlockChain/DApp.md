A decentralized application have a [[BackEnd Development|backend]], front end  and a [[BlockChain]] integrated with it. [[BackEnd Development|backend]]s are optional as ethereum it self is the new [[BackEnd Development|backend]]

[[Smart Contract]] is run by [[Solidity Language]] and combinind those sugar and spice, we appropriate an [[Ethereum]] [[Network]].
