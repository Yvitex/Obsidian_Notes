Is a fungible token, meaning it is the reverse of [[Non-Fungible Token]] or NFT. This means that we could exchange 1 token to another token of the same type because it makes no difference. 1 usdt is still equal to 1 usdt.

Tokens are built upon this function. We only need the first 3 functions if we want to imitate [[Bitcoin]] that could only transfer token to another address. 

But because we are in the realm of [[Smart Contract]]s, then we could use the second set of functions that prevent us from accidentally sending tokens to nothingness. 

The third set are just optional.
