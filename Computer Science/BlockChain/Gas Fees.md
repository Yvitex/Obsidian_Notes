# Gas Fees
Gas fees is the payment we send to the [[miners]] to include our transaction to the [[Blocks of Blockchain|blocks]]. The higher we pay, the faster the miner will include our data because it will be prioritized. 

Gas fees are cacluated using Gwei which is equivalent to: $$Gwei = 0.000000001 eth$$
The formula will be $$Transaction \space cost(g) \times Gas \space price(g)$$
## Example
Gas price = 100 gwei
Transaction gas cost = 21,000
$$Transaction \space cost(g) \times Gas \space price(g)$$
$$21000 \times 100 = 2100000$$
Convert into [[Ethereum|ether]]:$$2100000 \times 0.000000001 = 0.0021 eth$$
Setting the gas price in the lowest might ignore your transaction.

ethereum burns the excess coin yeah? Overpriced gas fees will cause the excess coin to burn. So when  minted [[Smart Contracts Popular Types|token]] is less than burned [[Smart Contracts Popular Types|token]], the rate of ether will be diflationary.
