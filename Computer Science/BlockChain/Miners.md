For each transaction we made to the [[BlockChain]], such as sending a [[Cryptocurrency]] to another user, we need to send it to the system/[[Network]] which is a bunch of [[Blockchain Nodes|node]], the [[Network]] will build a puzzle in which miners compete to solve it first. The first one to do so receives an amount of payment called [[Gas Fees]]
