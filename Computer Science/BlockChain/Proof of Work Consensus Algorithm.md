# What is Proof of Work

An algorith that runs for  [[Reaching Consensus]] in famous blockchain networks such as [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]]

This requires the involvement of [[Miners]] to solve a particular cryptographic puzzle to prevent anybody from disrupting the system.

Proof of work is inefficient so [[Ethereum]] network switched to [[Proof of Stake]]. It requires so much energy becaus eof computational power and a lot of miners already built specialized mining rigs such as ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) mining rig.
