# Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are basically a contract but using code. 
## 3 Main Characteristcs
- Automated - the software automatically do some action
- Verifiable - everybody could see how it works, or it is transparent
- Immutable -  the program does not change without the user's knowledge


There are difference between the smart contracts of [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]]

## Bitcoin
An example is a trading bot, where it automatically trades some bitcoin but in this example, we have this problems
- Automation - yes, it is automated
- Verfiable - well. somehow you could verfiy it but not all people will
- Immutable - no, it can be changed by rewriting the program

It is different when it comes to transaction, which is a simple smart contract
- automation - yes
- verifable - transparent over the network, verified by people
- Immutable - who knows?

So therefore, Bitcoin smart contracts is not much of a smart contract we knew. It only enables simple ones.

Bitcoin is a smart contract platform that enable us to perform some transaction using predefined codes. Also, vending machines are also a smart contract device as it enables automated transaction between consumer and the machine. But did you know that smart contracts are not really decentralized? Well all blockchain programs are not really decentralized as they need third party groups to fix their bugs and etc. And they could cheat the code and commit theft. Here is the [source](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-bitcoin-smart-contract-platform)

```

Though we know that even though the programmers could cheat, smart contracts are transparent, or verfiable therefore it is trustless. 

## Ethereum
Ethereum is actually the most famous smart contract platform right at this moment. It enables compelx contracts to run on their network. In a program...
- automated - yes, like any other
- verifiable - yes, the source code can be verified by anyone
- Immutable - Yes, no one could change it,

In transaction, it could be the same as bitcoin

The only difference is that the ethereum could run complex smart contracts. In this contracts on a [[BlockChain]] network, every [[Blockchain Nodes|node]] or participant create a duplicate of the original program. Redundant but ensure  security. 

Example source code for [smart contract](0x39eF42c567B849f087ec883d584d6AE62d22b061), go to the contract section. This is a transaction between test net in etherum to unicorn conversion/ See, [[Smart Contract]]s are verifiable.
