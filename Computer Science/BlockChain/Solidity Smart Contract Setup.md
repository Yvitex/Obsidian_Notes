# Solidity Code
In this lesson, we will use a website that is supported by [[Solidity Language]] called [Remix](https://remix-project.org/)

Create a new file called My_Contract
![[Pasted image 20220629162940.png]]

Inside the file, we first declare the `SPDX-Licence-Identifier`
```sol
// SPDX-Licence-Identifer: MIT
```

Next is we identify the version number of the programming language
```sol
pragma solidity = 0.8.15;
```

Use fixed value for security reason. 

Next is we create a function using the keyword `contract`
```solidity
// SPDX-Licence-Identifer: MIT

pragma solidity = 0.8.15;

contract MyContract{

}
```
