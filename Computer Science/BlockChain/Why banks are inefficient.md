# Inefficient Banking System
Basically, governments and the bank could do what they want to your money, it require your trust which is... err. As the saying goes, never trust anyone... even yourself. For example, there are a lot of fees, even hidden fees you need to pay in order to maintain your account. The government could freeze your account whenever they want. [[Cryptocurrency]] on the other hand is decentralized, though there are also similar scams here and there, it is relatively safer than the former and also, it does not require such fees except [[Gas Fees]] for miners
