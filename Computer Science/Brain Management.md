## Killing ANST

Reducing automatic negative self-talk is necessary to avoid the risk of negative self-programming and there are some ways to do this. Using the method of ABRA or Acknowledge, Breathe In, Release, Align. We should acknowledge this negativity, don’t force it to disappear or they will persist, breathe in, then release, visualize the negativity out of your body. Align yourself with new positive talk, align with a better perception.

## Chain Linking

A technique to train your brain ang memorize more than 10 random words forward and backwards. This uses imagination and chaining events along with the picture you imagine. For instance you have these words:
- Fire Hydrant
- Baloon
- Battery
- Barrel
- Board
- Diamond
- Sir Lancelot
- Mask
- Toothpaste
- Sign

We will then visualize the fire hydrant, having some balloon that suddenly flew up then pops by battery and so on... It is important to use emotions, and exageration with this kind of technique. 
How can we use it for technical informaiton like memorizign the periodic table? Simply we convert the names of the item into pictures, if we can't then find something that is related to it, sounds like it that is easy to visualize. For example:
- Hydrogen - we could visualize it as hydrant cos they sounds similar
- Helium - we could visualize it as baloon, as in helium baloons
- Lithium - as in litthium batteries
- Beryllium - as in barrel
- Boron - as in board
- Carbon - diamond are carbons compressed by pressure
- Nitrogen - sir lacelot is a knight, and it sounds like knightrogen
- Oxygen - to recover a patient we use an oxygen mask
- Flourine - toothpaste usually contains flouride
- Neon - there are millions of neon sign everywhere. 

## The PEG Memory

This technique utilize the Sun List in Logical Linking technique.
1. Sun
2. Socks
3. Traffic Light
4. Car
5. Star
6. Soda
7. Rainbow
8. Octopus
9. Cat
10. Toes

Logical linking is where we associate the word with the number, for example, there is only 1 sun in the milky way, cars have 4 wheels, cat have 9 lives, there are 2 socks. Peg memory will use this association in order to memorize any words scrambled. For example we have this list
1. Dream
2. Learning
3. Passion
4. Transparent
5. Help
6. Fan
7. Celebration
8. Kick
9. Magnet
10. Action

We will imagine that we are dreaming burning in the sun, we iamgine then when we open a book, we will encounter a dirty smelly socks, book will signify learning. Or at the end of the rainbrow their is a celbration of elves and spirits, this will asoociate 7. Rainbow with Celebration.
