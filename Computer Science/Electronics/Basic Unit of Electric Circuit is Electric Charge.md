# What is a Charge
<blockquote>Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in coulombs (C).
*<cite style="color: red">--AC1 module page 4</cite></blockquote>

The electrical charge of atomic components are as follows;
- Electrons : $$-1.602 \times 10^{-19}\space C/e$$
- Protons : $$1.602 \times 10^{-19} \space C/e$$
- Neutron: [[Electric Charge|Ground State = 0]]

C/e means coulombs per electron.

the unit of charge is called coulombs
