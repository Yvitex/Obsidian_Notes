# What is a Cutoff Region
In this state, the transistor is off.

In simple terms, the [[Voltage|potential]] of the base is less than the potential of [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|collector]] and [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|emitter]]

## Mathematically
$$V_C >V_B < V_E$$

The state of [[Voltage Relationships in BJT|V_be]] in this case is less than 0.6, as we know, cutoff region is in an [[Transistors 3 Region|off]] state
$$V_{BE} < 0.6$$
The source voltage is also equal to the difference beween the voltage of collector and emitter:
$$V_{CE} = V_{CC}$$
It is a cutoff region if the current in the collector is 0 because the transistor is off.
$$I_C = 0$$

Because the potential is less in the base, [[Electrons]] are inclined to go away from it to terminal with high potential. Take note that [[Electric Current]] moves in opposite direction which is why the current are moving to the base, while electrons are moving away. In other words, the nature of [[Electric Current|Current]] is to move from high potential or [[Voltage]] to low potential
