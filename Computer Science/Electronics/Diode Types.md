# Types of Diodes
These are the basic types of [[Diodes]]
1. Zener Diode - have specific breakdown or zener voltage. used to generate fixed voltage

2. Transient Voltage Supressor - used to protect sensitive coponent, reacts to [[Voltage]] spikes.

3. Photodiode - light sensor that cnvert light energy to electrical. Similar to a solar panel

4. [[LED ]]- emits light when [[Electric Current|Current]] flows. Allows current to flow forward but not backward

5. Varactor or Varicap Diodes - provide voltage controlled variable capacitance.

6. Schottky Diode - Used in [[Switching Operations]], with less power loss and faster response time.  Causing of zener.
