# Electron Flow

In an [[Electric Circuit]]. Electrons flow from **negative to positive**. The opposite of this is called [[Holes Flow]] but basically, electron flow simply means [[Electricity]]

The flow of electrons is the opposite of the flow of current. In other words, the flow of holes is the same as the flow of current
