# What is Kirchoff's Voltage Law

This states that the summation of all voltage in a [[Network Topology Branches|Loop]] is equals to zero

## Mathematical Formula
 $$\sum_{m=1}^M v_m= 0$$
- M - voltage in the loop
- m - mth voltage

### Consider this Diagram

Because the current runs in a clockwise rotation, some voltage will ne negative and so adding all componenets such as:
$$-v_1+v_2+v_3-v_4+v_5=0$$

With this equation, we can conclude that the **voltage drop is equals to the voltage rise** in a [[2 Extreme Scenarios of a Circuit|close]] [[Network Topology Branches|Loop]]

The formula concede to the [[Law of Conservation of Energy]]
