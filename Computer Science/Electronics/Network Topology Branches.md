1. Branch - Represent a single element, in the example above, we could see 5 branches(3 [[Resistors]], 2 [[2 Types of Electronic Sources|source]])
2. Node  - point of connection between 2 or more branches, in the example above, we have 3 nodes namely a, b and c. In other sense, the circuit looks like this![[Pasted image 20220602135837.png]] 
3. Loop - any closed path in circuit

## Mathematical Formula Of Network Topology
 $$b = l + n - 1$$
