# What is a Saturation Region
At this state, both the [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|collector and emitter]]  are in [[Forward Bias]] mode
Saturation region is simply the maximumum current it could hold. We know that the formula for calculating the [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|BJT]]'s collector current is $$I_C = \beta I_B$$
And if, $I_B$  increases, then $I_C$ will also increases: $$\uparrow I_C = \beta \uparrow I_B$$
But in saturation region. even though $I_B$ increases, $I_C$ will not: $$I_{C(max)} = \beta \uparrow I_B$$

## Mathematically
$$ I_E<I_B > I_C$$
Like in [[Active Region]], [[Voltage Relationships in BJT|V_CE ]] here is greater than or equal to 0.6

The value of V_CE is equal to zero.
$$V_{CE} = 0$$
Though $$I_C = I_S$$  
- Where $I_S$ is the saturated current, meaning $I_C$ is at its maximum

The formula for saturated current is
$$I_C = \frac{V_{CC} - V_D}{R_C + R_E}$$
- where Vcc is the Voltage Source
- VD is the voltage drop, 0 if none
- Rc is the resistance of the collectr
- RE is the resistance of the emitter

## Diagram

As we can see on the diagram, the potential of the base is the highest so [[Electrons]] go there but the reverse happense to the [[Electric Current]]

In this case, when I_B increase, I_C in saturation region does not compared to [[Active Region]] where when base current increase, collector current increase
