This diagram shows the distribution of electrons in an atom, Each of the circular orbits is called a Shell, and each shell has a specific number of electron it could hold

Here is a diagram that represents each shell and their electrons limits

This representation could tell us if an [[An atom is stable if their valence shell has complete set of electrons|atom is stable]] or not.
