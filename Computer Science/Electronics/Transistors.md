# What are transistors?
They are like 2 [[Diode]] connected to each other. It came form 2 words, **transform and resistor**.

This is a NPN transistor, the [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|collector]] and [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|emitter]] are both negative and the base is positive. This is the msot common type of transistor because of its mobility as it utilizes [[Electron Flow]] 
## Purpose
- [[Amplification]] or increase the power of voltage wherein the greater the resistance, the greater the voltage $$(iR = v) \lt (i\large \uparrow R =  \uparrow V)$$
- [[Switching Operation]] such as for storing data in memory card


## Structure

Because emitter is the source of [[Charge Carriers]], it is highly doped, collector is moderately doped and base is lightly doped as those need more space to accept [[Atom is the smallest particle than an element can be reduced to|electron]] or [[Holes]]. Move to [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]] for more info

- Emitter is highly doped but low cross section area
- Collector is moderately doped but with high cross section area

## Types
1. [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]]
2. [[Field Effect Transistor]]
3. [[Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor]]

Very small like a coin

## Did You know??
The smallest transistor ever recorded has the minimum size of 2 nanometer, smaller than the size of a DNA molecule with at least 2.4 nm
