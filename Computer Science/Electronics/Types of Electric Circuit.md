# Types of Circuits
![[Pasted image 20220602140914.png]]

1. Parallel - 2 or more [[2 Types of Element in a Electronic Circuit|element]] that are connected in the same 2 [[Network Topology Branches|node]] and have the same [[Voltage]]. In the example above, **6 ohms and 2 ampere is parallel**

The formula for Resistance is:
$$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}$$
### Shortcut
This only works for 2 resistors in parallel
$$R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$

2. Series - 2 or more elements that shares a same node and have the same [[Electric Current|Current]]. In the example above, **10 volts and 5 ohms are in series**

The formula for Resistance is:
$$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + Rn$$
