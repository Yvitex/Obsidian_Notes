## Just a Bunch of Formulas
$$V_{BE} = V_B - V_E$$
also there is a limit in V_be, it could only range from 0.6 - 0.7
$$V_{BE} = 0.6 \space to \space 0.7$$
This measures the Voltage difference of Base Voltage and Emitter Voltage
$$V_{CE} = V_C - V_E$$
This measures the Voltage difference of colelctor Voltage and Emitter Voltage
$$V_{EE} = V_E - V_E = 0$$
This measures the Voltage difference of ground and ground which is both zero
$$V_{CB} = V_C - V_B$$
This measures the Voltage difference of Collector Voltage and Base Voltage
$$V_{CC} = Source \space Voltage$$
This measures the Voltage difference of source voltage to ground.
$$V_{BB} = V_{CC}$$
This is the same as $V_{CC}$ but in opposite direction near the base voltage and  ground
