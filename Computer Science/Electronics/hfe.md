# What is hfe?
Its an abbreviation that means **Hybrid Parameter Forward Current Gain, common**  [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|emitter]]

## What is it used for?
It is used to measure the current gain of [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|junction transistor]]


## Tricks
If $$hfe > 100$$
then  $$I_C \approx I_E$$
