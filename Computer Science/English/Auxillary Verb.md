# What is an Auxillary Verbs?
They are also called as "helping verbs"

#### Present tense Auxillary Verbs
- Do - Plural
- Does - Singular
- Am - Singular
- Are - Plural
- Is - Singular

### Common Auxillary Verb
- Is/Was
- Are/Were
- Did/Does
- Will/Could/Would


In Subject Verb Aggreement, If it is does or do, we use the auxillary verbs as the main verbs to be changed and not the current [[Verb]].

If it is are, is and am, we add -[[Gerunds|ing]] to the actual verb, check the example [[Present Continuous Tense|here]]

## Example #1
- "She often sleeps very late" - 'She' is singular, 'sleeps' is also singular

Now, if we use an Auxillary Verb

- "She does often sleep very late" - 'She' is still singular, 'Does' is also singular, 'Sleep' is on its [[Verb's 3 Main Forms|base form]]

## Example #2
- "They sometimes drive to work" - 'They' is plural, 'drive' is also plural

Now, if we use an Auxillary Verb

- "They do sometimes drive to work" - 'They' is plural, 'do' is also plural, 'drive' is on its base form
