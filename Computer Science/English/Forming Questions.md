# Forming Questions
There are 2 types of ways we could form question. 

## Closed Question
Resnspose is shorter like "Yes, I am"
### Construction
[[Auxillary Verb]] + Subject + [[Verb]]
- "Are you good at english?"
- "Did you just eat lunch?"

## Open Question
Response are longer and more complex, like "I don't know, ask my friend"
### Construction
W Questions +  [[Auxillary Verb]] + subject + [[Verb]]

#### W Question Tier List
1. What
2. Where
3. When 
4. Who
5. *Why* 
6. *How*

*Why and How* is a madman's question where the response should be a spontaneous combustion of fart to my brain. Yes, it requires a long and complex response. 

Combining this W questions with [[Auxillary Verb]]s may summon the ancient demon, Lucifur. Here are the combinations where the button right corner is the deepest most brainwacking question you could ask.

#### Example

- "Where were you yesterday?"
- "How might you feel, when you accidentally pee on your bed?"
- "What's she doing now?"
- "What was she doing last monday?"

```ad-Attention
collapse: open
[[Contraction]] can only be used at "What is" as "What's" but it sounds terrible in [[Past Continuous Tense]] "What was", so we do not contract it.
