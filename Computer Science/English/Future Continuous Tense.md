# Future Continuous Tense
We use this to discuss an ongoing event in the future. Similar to [[Future Simple Tense]], it discuss events that haven't happened yet.


## Rules
Normal: Subject + will + be + verb + [[Gerunds|ing]]
Negative: Subject + will not/ won't + be + verb + ing
Question: Wh? + will + [[Pronouns|pronoun]] + be + verb + ing


## Normal Example
- "**We'll be waiting** at platform 3 at 5pm"
- "**You'll be wishing**  you took my advice

[[Contraction]]s were used in this examples, added with the word 'be' after 'will'. After this, we will transfer the actual [[Verb]]s as [[gerunds]] or [[Noun]]s at diguise

## Negative Example
- "He **won't be visiting** this weekend"
- "Kim's family **won't be calling** us today"

The only change is that we add the word not.

## Question Example
- "How **will you be paying** today, sir?"
- "Who **will you be supporting** tommorow?"

Same rules applies


Note: Just remember that the magic word is 'will be'
