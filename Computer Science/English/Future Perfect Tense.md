# Future Perfect Tense
This is used to descrine a future action that will happen before another event

## Rules
Normal: Subject + will + have + verb([[Verb's 3 Main Forms|PP]]) 
Negative: Subject + will not/ won't + have + verb(PP)
Question:  

## Normal Example
- "I will have finished before the end of the day"
- "She'll have spent 6 years in Osaka by the time summer arrives"

In those examples, we could see two events happening subsequently. If not, at least the example have timeframes. We'll just need to add 'will have' and change the verb form into  [[Verb's 3 Main Forms|past participle]]. One thing i noticed is that for all perfect tenses, [[Future Perfect Tense]] or even [[Present Perfect Tense]] and [[Past Perfect Tense]], we either use has, had or have. Had of course is for past tense. 

## Negative Example
- "You **won't have** left by 4pm"
- "We **won't have had** enough time to save by the time we plan to buy a house."
