# Future Simple Tense
Used when describing an action that haven't happened yet

## Rules
Normal: Subject + will + verb + object
Negative: Subject + will not/ won't + verb + object
Question: Wh? + will + [[Pronouns|pronoun]], + verb


## Normal Example
- "**I will eat** a big breakfast tommorow"
- "**I'll apply** for a new course next month"

We could see that the [[Verb|verb]]s is on its [[Verb's 3 Main Forms|base form]]. We don't change anything but add 'will' before the verb 

## Negative Example
- "He will not go to the coffee shop later"
- "They won't attend for an afternoon meeting"

To negate the sense, we simply need to add 'not' after 'will'. Notice that the words 'will not' feel like there is a stress, like indication of anger, in this case, [[Contraction]] could help us by mergin 'will' and 'not' to form 'won't'

## Question Example
- "Where will you travel this summer?"
- "Why won't you listen to me?"

Notice that the second example implicates a stress, somehow sounds like desparation. We can't use 'Why will not you...', it doesn't sounds so good. Just be careful on those.
