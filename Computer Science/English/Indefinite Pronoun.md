# What is an Indefinite Pronoun?
They are words such as: **nobody,  everyone, someone, somebody**

In a subject- verb agreement, every indefinite pronoun is accompanied by a [[Verb|singular verb]]

## Examples
- "**Everyone likes** playing games together" - 'Everyone' even though it is a lot of people, we will use a singular form of verbs 'likes'  <hr>

- "**Nobody thinks** the Earth is flat anymore" -  'Nobody' even though it is a lot of people, we will use a singular form of verbs 'thinks'
