# What are Intransitive Phrasal Verb?
Phrasal [[Verb]] that cannot have a [[Noun|subjec]]t after them

## Example
- "[[Pronouns|She's]] really **grown up**. I'm very proud of her" - I think this is allowed because the phrasal verb is after the subject
- "In all honesty, it was a terrible **break up**"
