# Past Continuous Tense
We use this tense when describing an action that is an ongoing process that happened in the past and finished.

## Rules
Normal: Subject + [[Past Tense - Be Verb (Extras)|was/were]] + Verb + [[Gerunds|ing]]
Negative: Subject + wesn't/weren't + [[Verb]] + ing
Question: Wh? + was/were + [[Pronouns|I/You/He/She/It/You/We/They]] + verb + ing

## Normal Example
- "She was watching TV before"
- "The new lightnovel was selling many copies"

Here, we use some [[Past Tense - Be Verb (Extras)|be verbs]] and [[Gerunds]] combination to represent a past continuous tense. The only change we could add is it it was was or were

- "We weren't leaving work early"
- "Kim and Bon weren't dating anymore"
