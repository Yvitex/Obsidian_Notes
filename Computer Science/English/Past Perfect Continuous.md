# What is Past Perfect continuous?
Used to describe a long term action or something that continued happened in the past before another event. This is just like [[Past Perfect Tense]] but with continuity.


## Rules
Normal: Subject + had + been + verb + ing
Negative: Subject + hadn't + been + verb + ing
Question: Wh? + had/hadn't + [[pronouns]] +  been + verb + ing

## Normal Example
- "She had been **exercising** before she rested"
- "The car was wet because it had been **raining**"

We could see that in both example has 2 different events like a [[Past Perfect Tense]], so we use had like before. We also append been to the sentence like [[Present Perfect Tense]] and add a [[Gerunds]] like so. One thing i noticed is that 'has' and 'have' is used for [[Present Perfect Tense]] and [[Present Continuous Tense]] while in [[Past Perfect Tense]] and continuous use 'had'. The second example also has a [[Past Tense - Be Verb (Extras)|be verb]] in past tense. 

## Negative Example
- "I **hadn't been studying** before I took my test"
- "My friends are happy because they **had been hanging** out together"

## Question Example
- "Why had she been lying to me?"
- "Where had you been travelling before here?"
