# Past Perfect Tense
We use this when describing an action that happened before another action

## Rules
Normal: Subject + had + verb([[Verb's 3 Main Forms|PP]])
Negative: Subject + hadn't + verb(PP)
Question: Wh? + had + subject + verb(PP) + before/by the time 

## Normal Example
- "He had **lied** to his mum before he left"
- "He had **fallen out** by the time we reached the hotel"

Note: Fallen out is an example of [[Phrasal Verbs]]
One thing to notice here is the word had, even though it is a [[Auxillary Verb]], it was not allowed to be modifed, singular or plural pronoun doesn't affect it a lil bit. The actual verb on the other hand is changed to a Past Participle. It is a special case for a past perfect tense.

We can also see that there are 2 events happening in this sentence. In the first example, the subject lief first before leaving home. The second example, the subject had fallen out befure reaching the hotel. Maybe you could just look for verbs, if there are 2 or more, then we use past perfect tense


## Negative Example
- "Sarah hadn't gone home when I arrived home"
- "They hadn't added their purchase together so didn't know how much they spent"

We could see there is 2 verbs in the sentence, 'arrived home' and 'gone home'. The second example has 2 verbs, 'added' and 'did'

## Question Example
- "Why had she gone to work so early?"
- "What had he eaten before he start running?"

Both sentences indicate two events
