# What is Past Simple tense
We use this to talk about actions that are already happened at the **past** and already complete


## Rules
Normal: Subject + [[Verb]]([[Verb's 3 Main Forms|past]]) + object
Negative: Subject + didn't + verb + object
Question: Wh? + did + [[Pronouns|I/You/He/She/It/You/We/They]] + verb(base form)

## Normal Example
- "He **listened** to spotify this morning"
- "We **jumped** over the wall"

A very simple form, we just need to add "-ed" if it is a [[Regular Verb]], if [[Irregular Verb]], then some parts of the word might change

## Negative Example
- "He didn't **listen** to spotify this morning"
- "I didn't **call** my auntie on the phone"

In here, in the [[Contraction]] part, we used an [[Auxillary Verb]], because of this, we don't need to change the actual vern and remain on [[Verb's 3 Main Forms|base form]]

## Question Example
- "Why did she **travel** to England?"
- "When did they **see** the movie?"

Similar rules to the negative example, we use an auxillary verb so the actual verb does not need to be modified
