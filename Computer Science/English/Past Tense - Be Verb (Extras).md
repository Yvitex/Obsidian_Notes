# What is a Be Verns?
A phrase with 'to be' words such as "I am sleeping at my couch"

## Rules
Here, we simply use **was/were** depending on the [[Pronouns]] used
- 'I' - 'Was'
- 'He, she, it' - 'Was'
- 'They, we, you' - 'Were'

The first example violates [[I and You]] rule. Instad of using a plural [[Auxillary Verb]], we use a [[Verbs in Singular Form]] instead.

Second example is obvious based on [[Subject-Verb Agreement]], when the [[Pronouns|Pronoun]] is singular, the [[Verb]] is also plural

Third example on the other hand, the pronouns are plural so we use [[Plural Verb]] instead

## Example
- "I was afraid"
- "She was quite sick yesterday"
- "The tree wasn't very tall"
- "My friends were all at the park"
