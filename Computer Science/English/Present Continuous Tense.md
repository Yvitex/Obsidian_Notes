# Present Continuous Tense
We use this when an action is happening now or happens often, similar to [[Present Simple Tense]]

## When to use
We use it when talking about
- Actions happening right now = "The guest are arriving now" and "The computer is loading"
- A longer action in progress = "I am studying to learn English" and  "She's practicing martial arts"
- Near future plans = "We're going on holiday next week" and  "I'm seeing my friends tommorow"

I though "near future plans" should belong to [[Future Simple Tense]]

```

## Rules
Normal: Subject + am/are/is + Verb + [[Gerunds|ing]] + Object
Negative: Subject + am/are/is + not + Verb + [[Gerunds|ing]]
Question: Wh? + Are/is + Subject + Verb + [[Gerunds|ing]]

## Normal Example
- "**I'm buying** a pair of shoes"
- "**Sally and David are making** a sculpture"
- "**The computer is making** weird noise"

The first example involves [[Contraction]], where I am == I'm. I and am is usually paired as [[Common Subject Verb Agreement Combination]]. Also with [[2 Singular Subject with And]] between them, it is perceived as plural therefore our verb must also be plural. While computer is a [[Common Noun]], and a singular one of the sort, we combined it with a [[Verbs in Singular Form]]
And also, because we have those [[Auxillary Verb]] like am, are, is, we don't necessarily change the actual [[verb]] but because we are in a continious tense, we add -[[Gerunds|ing]] at the end of each verb

## Negative Example
- "He's not going to the office" or "He isn't going to the office"

Here we also use contractions and concede the subject verb agreement with auxillary verbs while modifying the actual verb with -[[Gerunds|ing]]

## Question Example
- "When **is** he **visiting**?"
- "Why **are** you **doing** that?"

[[Common Subject Verb Agreement Combination]], the only difference it has with [[Present Simple Tense]] questions is that it does not include the [[Auxillary Verb]] of am.
