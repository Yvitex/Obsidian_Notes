# Present Perfect Continuous
To talk about past action that is still happening until today or in effect now. Notice it's difference with [[Present Perfect Tense]], while present perfect tense is used for events that still have an effect at the present, present perfect coninuous on the other hand is for past events still happening until today.

## Rules
Normal: Subject + [[Auxillary Verb|has/have]] + been + Verb + [[Gerunds|ing]] + object
Negative: Subject + hasn't/haven't + been + [[Verb]] + ing + object
Question: Wh? + has/have + [[Pronouns|I/You/He/She/It/You/We/They]] + been + ver + ing

## Normal Example
- "You have been **learning** English today"
- "The phone's been **ringing** for ages"

The second example use a [[Contraction]] to shorten 'phone' and 'has'. 

## Negative Example
- "She hasn't been **sleeping** a lot"
- "We haven't been **working** for 2 weeks"

Same rules applies, we just add the word 'not' with the [[Auxillary Verb]]. The actual vern turns into [[Gerunds]]
## Question Example
- "Have you been **sleeping?"
- "Why has she been **crying**?"
