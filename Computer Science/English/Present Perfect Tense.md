# Present Perfect Tense
We use this to talk about **past actions** that still have an effect today

## Rules
Normal: Subject + [[Auxillary Verb|has/have]] + verb([[Verb's 3 Main Forms|PP]]) + Object
Negative: Subject + [[Contraction|hasn't/haven't]] + verb(PP) + Object
Question: Wh? + has/have + I/You/He/She/It/You/We/They + Verb(PP)

## Normal Example
- "Jhon has **gone** for a walk"
- "We have **forgotten** our schedules"

In perfect present tense, this involves events happened in the past and still have an effect to the present, Jhon goes for a walk and might still be walking until now and he's not at home. We use an [[Auxillary Verb]] for it and the actual verb is in [[Verb's 3 Main Forms| Past Particle]] form.

## Negative Example
- "She hasn't **flown** in an aeroplane"
- "They haven't **seen** their test results"

The same rules apply. Because they haven't seen their test result, they still don't know what their scores are. The only difference here is we use [[Contraction]] to shorten 'has' and 'not.  

## Question Example
- "What have I **done**?"
- "How has he **slept** in that tent?"
