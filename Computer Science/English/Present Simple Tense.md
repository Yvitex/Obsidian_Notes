# Present Simple Tense
We use this when an action is happening now or happens often, similar to [[Present Continuous Tense]]

## Rule
Normal: Subject + Verb (present) + Object
Negative: Subject + don't/doesn't + Verb (present) + Object
Question: Wh? + Am/Are/Is + [[Pronouns|Pronoun]] + Verb + [[Gerunds|ing]]

## Normal Example
- "We **read** at the library"
- "He **reads** at the library"

Remember the [[Subject-Verb Agreement]]? If the Subject, even if it is a [[Noun]] or a [[Pronouns|Pronoun]], is singular, we use a singular [[verb]], if the subject is plural, we use a [[Plural Verb]]. **Verb in a singular form requires us to add an (s) at the end**

See the rules to change the Verb into its singular form [[Verbs in Singular Form|here]]

## Negative Example
- "He **doesn't** enjoy long travel"
- "I **don't** exercise at the gym"

Take note the rules of Subject Verb Agreement on [[Auxillary Verb]]. The actual verb  in the example above didn't change. It is still on its base form and we don't add anything into it. 

**He, She** and it are singular
**I, you** is an exception based on [[I and You]] rule
**We and they** are plural

## Question Example
- "Where are you visiting?"
- "Are you singing at the show?"

[[I and You]] rule tells us that the verbs we will use along side should be at its plural form. Meaning no 's' at the end, we don't say 'Is you singing?', rather 'Are you singing?'

You and is in this case are [[Auxillary Verb]] and in this case, we add -[[Gerunds|ing]] at the end of the actual verbs
