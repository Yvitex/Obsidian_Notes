# HUD Class
Not really used anymore but can be use for debugging. Apparently, this means head up display which is used to [[Creating a Crosshair Widget|create widget]] that relay information to the player

## Setup
Within the BP folder to Current level folder, create a new class and search for HUD class. Rename it to the current level + \_HUD class

Go to [[Creating Game Modes|game mode]] and change the HUD to the created HUD class
