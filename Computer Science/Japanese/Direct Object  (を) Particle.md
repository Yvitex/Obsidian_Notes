This is used when we are doing something direct to that object. 
"Wo" pronounced as "O" is used to signify that a noun is a direct object of a verb. 
- Eat fish - 魚を食べる
- Drank juice - ジュウスを飲んだ

In japanese, places can also be a direct object if it is done at that place. For example:
- Aimlessly walk through town - 街をぶらぶら歩く
- Run through express way - 高速道路を走る

"Wo" is optional when used with noun + する. We could treat this noun + する as one verb.
- Study japanese everyday - 毎日、日本語を勉強する
