When used as aparticle, this is pronounced as "e".
This is almost the same as [[Target Particle （に）]] but the only difference is that, while target particle specifies a final intended destination, the directional particle is not clear or fuzzy about its final destination. Changing the に　with へ　produce a slight changes. 

- Bob headed towards Japan - ボブは日本へ行つた
- Not go home towards house - 家へ帰らない
- Come towards room - 部屋へくる 

So "he" could be directly translate as "towards". Also, it cannot be used in verbs that has no physical direction like 医者へなる, this is wrong, it should be 医者になる

But we could use it on abstract concept that is a future destination or goal. 
- Go towards victory - 勝ちへむかう
