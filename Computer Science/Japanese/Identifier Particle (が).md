# Identifier Particle (が)
が is used when we don't know yet the topic. Usually encountered in questions, for example, "Who is the student?", we say "誰が学生？"。We use this to identify something unidentified. 

- Who is the student? - 誰が学生？
- Bob is the one that is student - ボブが学生

We use が in a non question sentece when we are specifying something unique or specific. So we usually convert it with, "is the one". 

We could also say that "学生は誰 " because the topic will be the student which converts to "The student is who?". To make it easier, convert は as "as for, about" while が use, "the one, the thing"
