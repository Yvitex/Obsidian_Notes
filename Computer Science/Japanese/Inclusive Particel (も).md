# Inclusive Particel (も)
も could means "also" which includes another topic, person or thing to the conversation.
- Yeah, Bob is also a student: うん、ボブも学生だ。

We do not use a negative version with もas we can't say that "Yeah, but Bob is also not a student" if you are a student, right? We say,
- Yeah, but Bob is not a student: うん、でもボブは学生じゃない
- No, and Tom is also not student：ううん、トムも学生じゃない

Notice that we use は when the statesments are contradicting, and we use も when they are the same
