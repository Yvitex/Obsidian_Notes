# Na-Adjective
Adjective are words that describes a noun. Na-adjectives are japanese adjectives that does not end with 　い, or if it does it is usually written in kanji, there are some words that doesn't for example きれい and 嫌い still, this is a na word and to remember thsi, we don't have a choice but to memorize.

We call this な adjective as we  could modify a noun by sticking with な at the end of the adjective.
- Quiet person - 静かな人
- Pretty person - きれいな人

We could also use は instead for this
- Person is quiet - 人は静か
- Person is pretty - 人はきれい
- Friend is kind - 友達は親切

Or in a compounded mode
- Friend is kind person - 友達は親切な人

Also, I found it quite suprising that the japanese for "like" which is 好き is an adjective.
- Desirable person - 好きな人
- I like  - 好きだ
- A person that likes fish - 魚が好きな人

We don't use な for negative sentence and past tense
- A person that does not like fish　魚が好きじゃない人
- A person that did not like fish - 魚が好きじゃなかつた人
