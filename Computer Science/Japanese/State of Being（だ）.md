# State of Being（だ）

To say that a person is this, we use だ　as a kind of prefix. For example, to say "Is a person", we say　”人だ”　

- Is a student: 学生だ
- Is fish: 魚だ
- Is well: 元気だ

We could say that a state of being without using だ at all. For example, to sa that you are well, we simply say "元気” specially when you are being asked because we already knew the context and that is you. 

We use だ to declare something strongly or an emphasis. For past tense version of this word, we use the word だつた replacing だ 
- Was student: 学生だつた
- Was fish：魚だつた
- Was well：元気だつた

To express the negative version of this, we use append the word じゃない replacing だ. Do note that this will work only for noun and [[Na-Adjective]]
- Is not student: 学生じゃない
- Is not fish:　魚じゃない
- Is not well:　元気じゃない

The negative form of version of this word, we must replace the い from the  じゃない with かつた.
- Was not student：学生じゃなかつた
- Was not fish:　魚じゃなかつた
- Was not well:　元気じゃなかつた
