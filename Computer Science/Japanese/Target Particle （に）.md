This is different form [[Direct Object  (を) Particle]] in a sense that, direct object particle is used when we are doing something to that object while target particle is when we are doing something that is related to that object. 

In most cases, this is used to indicate a destination. 
- Bob went to Japan - ボブは日本に行つた
- Not go back home - 家に帰らない
- Come to room - 部屋にくる

Simply "ni" might translate ofter as "to". If you want to say "from", we say から or "kara"
- Alice came from Amerika - アリスはアメリからきた
- Will do homework from today to tomorrow - 宿題を今日から明日まだする

Location of an object is also a target so we use "Ni"
- Cat is in room -猫は部屋にいる
- Chair is in the kitchen - いすは台所にある
- Chair was in the kitchen - 椅子は台所にあつた
- Meet a good friend - いい友達に合つた
