# U-Verb (う)
Literally a verb that ends in U. Some るwords are actually う words so becareful. 

For the negative equivalence of the word, we replace う with わ and add ない
- 買う：かわない

if the verb don't  have う but still end with the sound of u. Change that word to the sound of a, for example ぶ to ば then add ない
- 遊ぶ：遊ばない
- 死ぬ：死なない
