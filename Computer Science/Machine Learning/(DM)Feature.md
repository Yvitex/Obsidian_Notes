# Features
Is like any other [[Exploring the Data (Methodology)|feature]], is just a variable that describes a measurement of certain things, such as body weight, height, age, etc. So ask ourselves what we already know about the [[(DM)Data]]. If we are trying to determine the possibility of a heart disease, we already knew that one of the factor is their body weight, we may use this knowledge to our advantage.

Feature is the different form of [[(DM)Data]] within the [[Structured Data]] or [[Unstructured Data]]
