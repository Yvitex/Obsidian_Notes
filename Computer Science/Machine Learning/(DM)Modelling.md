# Modelling
What kind of [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] should we use? There are many kinds of models which are good for specific things, what we want is a [[Machine Learning Algoritm|model]] that is good to be used in our problem

## Parts of Modelling
There are 3 parts of modelling. 
- [[Choosing a Model]] and [[Training our Model]] == [[Training Sets]]
- [[Tuning a Model]] == [[Validation Sets]]
- [[Model Comparison]] == [[Validation Sets]]

But before all of this, we need to split the [[(DM)Data]] set to 3 parts which are the training, validation and test set also called as the [[Three Sets]]
