# Problem Definition
Ask yourself, what problems are we  trying to solve, what kind of [[Machine Learning]] problem are we tring to do?. Is it a [[Supervised Machine Learning]] or [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]]?
Is it a [[Classification Machine Learning]] or [[Linear Regression|regression problem]]? We need to think about the [[Types of Machine Learning]] effective for our job

Think before you create, can this problem be solved using normal simple hand-coded instruction based system work? If yes, then you don't need a [[Machine Learning Algoritm]] to work for you. 

If we knew our input and output, use [[Supervised Machine Learning]]
If we knew our inputs but not the output use [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]]
If the problem is similar to other [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]], then use [[Transfer Learning]]
