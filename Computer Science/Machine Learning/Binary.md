# Binary
Binary is such thing such as 0 and 1. On and off. True or false. 
Binary simply means 2. And because we only have 2 values, it is much more efficient way to implment inside a [[Digital System]] as It is a<u> two state system</u>

Often we are familiar in this word because of cryptic information in binary form such as an 8 bit binary in a hacker movie. This is a form of number which is on a base 2 form in contrast to base 10 or [[Hexadecimal Notation|base 16]]

Can also be male or female, etc or anything related to [[Switching Operation]]

In a binary sequence we have 2 parts:
- [[Least Significant Bit]]
- [[Most Significant Bit]]

Each Binary Digit Is called a [[Bit]]

Binary Data are the the most simple things like images, mp4 files or mp3 files that are written in [[Binary]] or 1 and 0s
