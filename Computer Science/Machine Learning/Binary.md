# Binary
Binary is such thing such as 0 and 1. On and off. True or false. Binary means 2.

Often we are familiar in this word because of cryptic information in binary form such as an 8 bit binary in a hacker movie. This is a form of number which is on a base 2 form in contrast to base 10 or [[Hexadecimal Notation|base 16]]

Can also be male or female, etc or anything related to [[Switching Operations]]
