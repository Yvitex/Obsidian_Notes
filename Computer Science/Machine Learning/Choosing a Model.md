# Choosing  a Model
There are many kinds of [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] we could to solve a problem, but some [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] are better than the others.

For [[Structured Data]], we could use some libraries such as [[CatBoost]], [[XG Boost]] and decision tree like [[Random Forest]]

For [[Unstructured Data]], we could use [[Deep Learning]] or [[Transfer Learning]]
