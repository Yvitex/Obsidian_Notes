# Conda
Is a vitural assisistant like feature, but I view it as the same as [[NPM]] where it install libraries for us as well as all dependecies we need to use them. The manual can be found below

There is an alternative way to [[Install Modules in Conda]]

Other command:
List all environment
```shell
$ conda env list
```
