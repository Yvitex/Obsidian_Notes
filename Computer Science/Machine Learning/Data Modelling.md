# Data Modelling
Is the creation of visual representation existing between each [[Data Point]] and structures. Its goal is to describe or communicate relationship between datas and how can they be categorized or organized. 

In [[Machine Learning]], we are creating a good [[Machine Learning Algoritm|model]] which is an algorithm that will be used by machine in order to learn.

For each of the steps, we require to use different tools and knowing this tools will enable your to create a machine learning [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] and learn where to look when you can't solve a specific problem
