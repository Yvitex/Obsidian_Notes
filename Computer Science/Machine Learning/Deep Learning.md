# Deep Learning
Is a part of [[Machine Learning]] and [[Artificial Intelligence]] to imitate how humans learn certain things. 
This is important in [[Data Science]] in discoverting [[intricate]] structures of data. 

Deep learning is an art of finding patterns throughout a [[Structured Data]] or even [[Binary]].

This works on that we call [[Convolutional Neural Network]] where each node contains a specified image of the photo, for example one node may contain the information about the eyes, another is what the foot looks like. In this way it would recognize what the dog looks like by combining all those info into one. 

Thre are different [[Kinds of Deep Learning Problem]]

## Tools
One of the best tools out there for deep learning is [[TensorFlow]]
