# Dot product
Is a mathematical calculation that is about multiplying the rows to the columns and adding them, Here is a good [resource](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html) to read about them. ![[Pasted image 20220728060031.png]]

$(1 * 7)+(2 * 9)+(3 * 11) = 58$
After this, we will continue multuplying the row 1, 2, 3 to the column 8, 10, 12 then put it to the next column and so on. The [[Shape of Numpy|shape property]] above is (2, 3) and (3, 2). 

This is also called *Matrix Multiplication*
A good calculator to test this is [MatricMultiplication](http://matrixmultiplication.xyz/)

One way it could be useful can be reflected in the table below

The way that total is calculated us by multiplying the price of each feature and adding them all together for each row such as 
$(2 * 10) + (7 * 8) + (12 * 1) = 88$
