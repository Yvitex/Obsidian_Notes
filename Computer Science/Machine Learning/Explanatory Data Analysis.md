# Data Exploration (Explanatory Data Analysis or EDA)
The goal here is to find out more about the data and become an expert on the dataset you are working with

1. What question's are you trying to solve?
2. What kind of data do we have and how do we treat each data types?
3. What's missing in the data and how will you deal with it?
4. Where are the outliers and why should we care about them?
5. How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?

This is the part where you research what individal [[(DM)Feature|feature]] really means. We already define a data dictionary in the [[Introductory Definitions]] yet we could found out more in the internet, for example what is atypical angina?
