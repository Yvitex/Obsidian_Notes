# Forward/backward attribute selection
Is the art of removing features that doesn't add any value to the [[Machine Learning Algoritm]]. An example of this is [[Multicollinearity]] or if some datas habve high value of [[Correlation]]s

In the backward attribute selection, we include all [[(DM)Feature|feature]] we have then slowly, removes some of the columns and if it doesn't affect the [[Accuracy]] or other [[(DM)Evaluation]] methods, then it means it is disposable

The forward attribute selection works in reverse where all we start with 1 then add some features.
