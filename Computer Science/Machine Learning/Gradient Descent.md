# Gradient Descent
This is an optimization algorithm in [[Machine Learning]] to find the minimum [[Cost function]].

This is done by measuring the steepness of the slope. The steeper it is, the far away it is from the minimum [[Cost function]]

And the steepness is calculated through calculating the function's [[Derivatives]]
