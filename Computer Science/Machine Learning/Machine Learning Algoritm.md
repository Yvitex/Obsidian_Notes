# Machine Learning Algorithm
Sometimes called as models. A normal [[Algorithm]] is a set of instruction with inputs to create a desired output. [[Machine learning]] algoritm on the other hand are input with output, and through this data, will find the instruction that will provide the best output.

It will try at least 1000000 times to find the right solution. Which is impossible for humans to do.
And when they do, it will be a jumble of codes tha human won't understand. 

The practical example is when we set a picture of snake as an input and program them to tell that it is a snake as an output. The computer will create the code that will make it output the correct output.

There are many [[Types of Models]] we could consider which are good to solve problems depending ont he [[(DM)Data]]
