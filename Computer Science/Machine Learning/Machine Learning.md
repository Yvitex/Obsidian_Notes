# How does a Machine Learns?
This is a 3 step process
$$Predict \rightarrow Calculate Error \rightarrow Learn$$

First is to predict or our initial guess, at first this will be a completely random number

Second is to calculate the error, this will measure how far we are from the actual answer

Third is to learn, or to adjust the data we have. Updating our initial guess then repeat to step 1.

This process is actually called an [[Algorithm]]
