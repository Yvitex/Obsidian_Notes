# Model Comparison
Is where we test our [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]]. It is natural to occur that when we are testing our [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]], the [[Test Sets]] is much less accurate or lower [[(DM)Evaluation]] metrics than the [[Training Sets]].

The Model Comparison above is called [[Balanced Mode]]
This is vary normal phenomenon and we do not need to worry about it, What we must look our for are the concept of [[Overfitting]] and [[Underfitting]]
