# Multicollinearity
This happens when one varianle is highly related to one another, but highly [[Correlation|correlated]] variables doesn't mean that you are facing multicollinearity. But just a possibility that it exist.

## Example
For body fat and weight, this is almost similar because most of avarage people are either fat or skinny. Body fat could already tell us about the weight indicating that these variables are highly correlated and facing multicollinearity.
