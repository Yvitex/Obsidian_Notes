# NUMPY 
## Set-up
```
import numpy as np
```

### Example
  ![[Pasted image 20220605141433.png]]
  
The shape of this variable is (2, 2) where the first number is the number of rows and the second is the number of column.  
Using a method called `.reshape()`, we could modify the shape into something else.

But it can't when the array shape is already been reshaped from the start.  
  
## Printing the columns  
  
To Print the columns, the syntax to use is variable \[:, 0] , where 0 is the column index you want to be printed.

## Transpose Method and 2d Arrays

We can convert this variable to the shape of 7 rows and 1 column by adding Â another \[] inside the array params. This will convert this into the shape of (1, 7) and to invert this number, we use `transpose()` method::: (7, 1)

Another way of doing is through the `reshape()` method.
