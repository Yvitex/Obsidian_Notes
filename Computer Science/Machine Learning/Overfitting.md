# Overfitting
Occurs when the [[Test Sets]] have higher performance than the [[Training Sets]].

This means that the [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] we created fits exactly with the [[Training Sets]], sounds good but the problem is the inability to perform accurately against unseen data. It is like seeing the test answers in a periodical exam before taking the exams, we memorized it but we didn't really learn.

This may occur because of [[Data Leakage]] from [[Test Sets]] to [[Training Sets]]

## Fix
Here are the fixes
- Collect more data
- Try a less advanced [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]]
