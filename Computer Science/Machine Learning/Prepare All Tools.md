# Prepare All Tools
```python
# Importing all Tools

# Data Exploration Tools and Plotting Libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Models from Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Model Evaluation from Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, recall_score, f1_score, precision_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, roc_auc_score, plot_roc_curve
```

Already import tools that you anticapte you need. Do not forget to comment what you are doing. All the [[(DM)Evaluation]] metrics, [[Get the Data Ready|Data preparation]] tools like [[Numpy Module]], [[SciKitLearn]], [[Pandas]] and some [[Machine Learning Algoritm|model]]s
