# Residual Sum of Squares
$$\sum_{i = 1}^n \big(y^{(i)} -h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})\big)^2$$


Residual Sum of Squares is the total residuals between the actual data and hypothetical line. The lower the value, the more accurate it is.

$h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})$ is the hypothetical data from the [[Linear Regression]] Formula while $(y^{(i)})$ is the actual data and we squared them up so it won't fall down into a negative value.
