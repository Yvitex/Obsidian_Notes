# Training the Model
Here we use the [[Training Sets]] as our [[(DM)Data]] that we will feed towards the chose [[Machine Learning Algoritm]]. 

The training data will be the X and the predicted value will be the [[Target]] y

It is important in training to reduce the time it takes to for our model to learn the data. ![[Pasted image 20220725155205.png]]

Depening on the type of [[(DM)Data]] we have, if it is [[Structured Data]], then it might took 3 min or less byt for [[Unstructured Data]], it might take 2 hours or more, It is important to reduce the data in the early stages before going full blown.
