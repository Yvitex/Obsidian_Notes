# Tuning a Model
We do this on the [[Validation Sets]] but  if not available we could use the [[Training Sets]]
Basically, it is used to adjust the parameters of our [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]]. Like how we adjust the temperature of an over to make the food cook at the right state.

Depending on the [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] used, we could adjust the parameters

In a [[Random Forest]], we could adjust the number of trees, in the [[Convolutional Neural Network]]  we could adjust the number of layers
