# Undefitting
Occurs when the [[Test Sets]] perform very very poorly in relation tot he [[Training Sets]]

The line goes linear and does not try to fit isnide the cluster of [[Data Point]]s. This occurs because the [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] we used does not understand the relationship between the data(X) and the target label(y). Or when our [[Test Sets]] is completely different from the [[Training Sets]] we used for creating our [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]] such as they have different [[(DM)Feature|feature]] etc...

## Fix
If this occurs, here are the possible solutions to consider
- Try a more advance [[Machine Learning Algoritm|models]]
- Increase model [[Hyperparameter]]
- Reduce amount of [[(DM)Feature|feature]]
- train longer
