# Variance
Is the measure of variability. This will tell you the degree of spread of the  data set in relation to the [[Mean]]. Defined as the average of the squared differences to the mean

The higher the variance == wider range of numbers
The lower the variance == lower range of number
$$\frac{\sigma^2 = (x_1 - mean)^2 + (x_2 - mean)^2 + \dots + (x_n - mean)^2}{n}$$


This looks like [[Residual Sum of Squares]] , we are squaring the differences to prevent the negatives.
