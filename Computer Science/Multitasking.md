Multiple devices uses the same [[Server Computer]]. It must have the ability to execute multiple [[Process of Programs]] or task "process, task". One [[Processor]] could run one [[Process of Programs]] but it could switch fast from one process to another. But if you have more than one cpu, then it is called <u>Multiprocessing</u>. This uses an <u>address space</u>, (maybe [[Memory address]]) to separate the programs and make it impossible for the other app to affect another. A single program can also split into multiple task called [[Multithreading]]
