# How Penetration Tester thinks?
1. [[Reconnaissance]] - active and passive, passive is about searching stuff on google such as their linkledn account, fb account, etc and scavenging relevant information we could use. Active is more anout [[Scanning and Enumeration]]
2. [[Scanning and Enumeration]] - we actively scan against a client. Then enumeration is about analyzing information and finding a way to attack the client
3. [[Gaining Access]] - exploitation. We access the client's server or computer. 
4. [[Maintaining Access]] - prevent being kicked out or regaining access.
5. [[Covering Access]] - deleting accounts, deleting malicious apps etc.
