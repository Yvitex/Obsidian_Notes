# Email Address Gathering
## Hunter IO

First step, if your target is a big organization, we could search ofr individual worker's email in [hunter.io](https://hunter.io/). I tried my best to access this site using various account and it almost waste majority of my time. It seems like [zoho mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) works here but not google. 

For example, if your target is the Tesla company, we could search the worker's name and email pattern using hunter io. and do a password spraying. 


## the Harverster
Aside from hunter io, we could also use the harverster  in the command line. We could see the example by typing its name on the command line
```shell
$ theHarvester
```

The syntax to use it is `theHarvester -d <domain name> -l <limit number> -b <search engine>`

```shell
$ theHarvester -d tesla.com -l 500 -b google
```

Here, we fucked up. Tring bing search engine and we got
```shell
theHunter -d tesla.com -l 500 -b bing
```
