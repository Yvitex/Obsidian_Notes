# How to create a Socket?

\[Important note: Do not name your python file as socket.py]

In any GUI or text editor like gedit, firstly, specify an interpreter for the language using the [[Shebang]] syntax, in our case, we are using [[Python Programming|python]]. Here, we will import the module called socket.

Next is we will specify a host and any [[Common Ports|port number]]

Using the socket module, we will store to a variable a socket object with a parameter of `socket.AF_INET` which is simply an [[IP Adress|IPV_4]] and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` which is probably, just a port.

with this, we could connect using the connect method in the instance of socket class. The argument must be a tuple

## Testing the Socket
Using netcat, we will try to listen on port 7777, which is the same port we did inside the soc.py file.

When we execute our file which is soc.py, the net cat program will connect to the port successfully
