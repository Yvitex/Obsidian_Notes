# Subdomain Hunt
This subdomain is basically finding the domain that is already there, apparent on the web. 

## Using Certificate Fingerprint
The easiest method to do this is by using websites such as [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/)

For an instance that we are allowed to enter this domain name

All subdomains ending with .telsa.com are available except the out of scope ones

Now we could see some of the domains

Some of the interesting domains to look out for are
- sso
- api
- dev
- vpn
- meet
And as we could see, there is a lot to  browse at using certificate fingerprinting

## Using Sublister
We first need to install our sublister using [[System Command]], `apt install`
```shell
$ apt install sublist3r
```

To check weather it is working, just type sublis3r to the command line
```shell
$ sublist3r
```

Now, notice our parameter have a thread option, the higher the thread option, the faster it is.![[Pasted image 20220626151005.png]]
As well as it is required to input a domain name
```shell
$ sublist3r -d tesla.com -t 100
```

Now it will print, some interesting domain we want.  We could compare the result with crt.sh

Other alternative tools we could use are [Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) which promotes more control and [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) that could identify dead and active domains. 

```ad-Notice
collapse: open
Not all domains and subdomain you acquire are still alive and breathing

```

We could readily use amass by the way without installing it. Kali has it. The syntax to use passively get the subdomain  is:
```shell
amass enum -passive -d tesla.com -src
```
