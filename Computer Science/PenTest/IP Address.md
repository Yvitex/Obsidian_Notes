aliases: [IP, Address Resolution]

This is a [[Network Layer]] protocol that is responsible for delivering the [[Packets]], this address is a kind of [[Logical Addressing|Logical Address]] unlike [[MAC Address]] but we could convert Ip address to [[MAC Address]] using Adress Resolution Protocol

In IPv4, we have 2 parts in the ip address. The Network the address belong to (Network ID) and next is the devices within that network (Host ID)

"That" Network have many classes that we could identify from class A to class E decreasing in size.
- Class A: Example is 203.0.113.112, everything before the first period is the network address, the rest are the devices within that network (204) and (0.113.112)
- Class B: 203.0.113.112, everything before the second paredios is the first part, the rest are the second (203.0) and (113.112)
- Class C: Everything before the third period is the first part and the rest is te second part (203.0.113) and (112)

collapse: open
Class A range from 0 - 127, B is from 128 - 191, C is from 192 - 223

```

This classes also identifies the range of the network, class a connects to a million of devices then decreases as it goes on. So in order to route the [[Traffic]] to the right path without going into unecesary routers in a class A network, we need to use [[Subnetting]]

To Identify owned ip addressed, we use this command in to our CLI

We could see there are 2 kinds of Ip addresses in the console. First is the inet or the IP v 4 and another is the inet6 which is the IP v 6. IP v 4 are written in decimal notation and IP v 6 was written in [[hexadecimal notation]]. In calculation, IP v 4 consist of 32 bits/8 bytes of data, 8 bits per parts such as (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32), 2 ^ 32 = 4,294,967,296 ip addresses which is not enough compared to 7 or 8 billions of device users in earth. Therefore, they created the IP v 6 which combinations ranges to the maximum of 2 ^ 128 =  3.4028236692093846346337460743177e+38.

Though, IP v 6 are oftenly unused because Ip v 4 have 2 types, public and private addresses. 

Private address often starts with 10, 172, and 192.168. Each device has its own private address and through our [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]] or [[Internet Service Provider]], we integrate those private address into one public address that can communicate accross the interweb. As the No of networks increase, the no of host decreases in the private address. 

IP address exist at [[Network Layer|layer 3]].
