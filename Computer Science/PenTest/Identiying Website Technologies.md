# How to identify website technologies?
Another essential part of [[Reconnaissance]] that may or may not help us in exploitation. 

## Using Website
We could use tools such as [builtwith](https://builtwith.com/) that will enable us to identify the technologies of a certain website. ![[Pasted image 20220626160331.png]]

We could see, we repeatedly see this akamai technology that also appear in our [[Hunting Subdomain (Passive)|subdomain gathering]] ![[Pasted image 20220626154754.png]]

## Using Browser Extension
We could use [wappalyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer-technology-pro/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg) to do this job. Simply go to their website and click the button. Tada~ ðŸŽµ

We could see that their website are created from PHP programming language

## Using Terminal
we could use the whatweb technology to do the job
```shell
$ whatweb tesla.com
```

Sometimes. we could use this information against them.  Just sometimes. 

## Using Burpsuite
Kali linux have a built in application called Burpsuite. We simply need to open a tab inside the application and when we open a website for an instance, it will intercept the traffic each time and to proceed forward we need to press the button forward or turn off the intercept functionality. This all happens inside the proxy tab.

Here we could see a [[Restful Api Architecture GET|get request]] to a certain route. Unless we press proceed, the page won't completely load.

See, it is still loading until now while i am writting this. Now because i turn off the intercept button. 

![[Pasted image 20220626165440.png]]

The page now is loaded

![[Pasted image 20220626165508.png]]

In the target section, we could see the technology the website is using sch as google apis, secured visit etc, some are not because i just accidentally gone to google so it was recorded here. Idiot me.

Going to the tesla.com file safe. we could see the get and response whenever we click something in a website

![[Pasted image 20220626170317.png]]

This will print out some of the information we already knew and more. This is where those tools such as wappalyzer and built with website are using to identify their technologies. Also, the process of get and response is called [[Traffic]]
