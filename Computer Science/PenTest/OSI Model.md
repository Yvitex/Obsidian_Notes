# OSI MODEL
Remember the mnemonics...*Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away*

OSI means Open System Interconnection reference Model, this have a total of 7 layers encapsulating each other like an onion hiding the complexity or details below it. 
These are the layers.

When receiving data, data goes from [[Physical Layer|layer 1]] to [[Application Layer|layer 7]], when sending data, data goes from [[Application Layer|layer 7]] to [[Physical Layer|layer 1]]

## Layers
- [[Physical Layer]]
- [[Data Layer]]
- [[Network Layer]]
- [[Transport Layer]]
- [[Session Layer]]
- [[Presentation Layer]]
- [[Application Layer]]

This layers are divided to 2 distinct layers. The <u>Lower Layers</u> composed of the first 3 lower layers which governs how data are passed from one computer to another in a network. The <u>Upper Layer</u> defines how  application can relate to the network using [[API]]

Sometimes, the [[Session Layer]], [[Presentation Layer]], and [[Application Layer]] are combined to a single [[Network Protocol]], for example is the [[SMB Protocol]]
