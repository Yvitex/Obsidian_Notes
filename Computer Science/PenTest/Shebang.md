# What is Shebang

Simply a #! used to specify a command nterpreter

We can say #!/bin/bash to say that the programming language we are using is [[Bash]]
or we can say #!/bin/python3 if what we are using in the terminal is [[Python| python programming langguage]]

Basically, it is used to execute a program in the terminal using **./filename.py**, without it, we need to explicitly declare the base interpreter before execution which is
**python3 filename.py**

Also called: Hashbang, sha-bang, poundbang 

Also means in english as operation.

<blockquote>"The Mafia boss who's runningÂ **the whole shebang**"</blockquote>
