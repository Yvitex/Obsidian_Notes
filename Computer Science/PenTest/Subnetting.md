# Subnetting Techniques
Subnetting is simply dividing a [[Network]] into 2 or more compartment of networks. 

[[IP Address]] could only indicate the network and the device address but cannot indicate the subnet where the [[Packets]] will travel to, this was solved using routers and their [[Subnet Mask]]

The most commont subnetting network used in household is the /24 (whack 24) network, it has the value of 255.255.255.0. Each placement consist of 8 bits, 255 is the result of each bit having their switch on.

## Subnet Mask Calculation
This is called /24 because of the amount of 1's in the bits of data which is (8 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 24). The number of host in this kind of subnet is 2 ^ n, where n is the amount of zeroes, in our standard case, 2 ^ 8 = 256 host, easy computation is by taking the 32  -  /number network, 32 - 24 = 8  as n. A host isÂ any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means . In our case, this are the number of connected device in a network.

Here is a simple table that could do the job of identifying the subnet by whack number. each number from 1 to 32 are whack placeholder number. Host are written in decreasing order by dividing itself to 2, subnet is computed thorugh a fibonacci sequence where previous subnet value was added to the host. If your subnet is on /14, therefore, the subnet value was 252, and because it is one second row, we will only have 2 placements plus zero placeholder and the resulting value was 255.252.0.0. 

In easier terms: first row = x.0.0.0, second = 255.x.0.0, third = 255.255.x.0, fourth = 255.255.255.x. Also remember that /32 is max = 255.255.255.255
/24 is for small businesses or for home plan. Large companies use lower whack as they need more host. 

## Number of Host and Subnets
Host is calculated by substracting 32 to the whack number, so if you have /24, then 32 - 24 = 8, we have a binary which is 2 bits, so there are 2 possibility.

The resulting host is simply the number of possible devices per subnets. So for example if you have this ip 199.199.4.110, then we could get the first possible ip in this subnet by converting it first to binary, getting its [[Subnet Mask]] which is 255.255.255.240 /28. 

| Address     | Binary                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| IP address  | 11111111.11111111.11111111.01101110 |
| Subnet Mask | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000 |

We calculate the starting IP then through [[AND gate]] combining this 2 address

| Address           | Binary                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| IP address        | 11111111.11111111.11111111.01101110 |
| Subnet Mask       | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000 |
| -----------       | ----------------------------------- |
| Resulting Address | 11111111.11111111.11111111.01100000 |

01100000 in decimal is equals to 96, therefore the starting value is 199.199.4.96 of that subnet. 
In our subnet mask, we have this binary 11110000, this are composed of 4 ones and 4 zeroes, to get the number of host, we multiply 2 by 2 with the frequency of 0s (2^4) and to get the number of subnets, we multiply 2 by 2 with the frequency of 1s (2^4) therefore, there are 16 subnets and with 16 host per subnets each minus network and broadcast equivalent to 14 host.

We could simply output this in this [website](https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html?cclass=any&csubnet=28&cip=199.199.4.110&ctype=ipv4&printit=0&x=115&y=17)

Subnetting is about how address can we fit (host) and the mask (255.255.255.0) behind it.
Always substract 2 to the total of the host, hence in /24 = 2 ^ 8 = 256 - 2 = 254 available host
People refers to their network as this. 168.8.1.0/24, and we already knew that /24 contains 256 or 254 host amd has a mask of 255.255.255.0. This means we have 254 possible devices from 168.8.1.1 to 168.8.1.254

In 10.1.0.0/16 has 255.255.0.0, 2 of the zeroes are free gain and the probable host is equivalent to 2 ^ 16 = 65,536. It can be a host from 10.1.0.1 to 10.1.1.254 which is 256 ^ 2 = 65,536 - 2

So why do we always substract it into 2, because of the network and broadcast id that will take up (network id = 10.1.0.0, and broadcast id = 10.1.255.255) or if 168.8.1.0 /24, then, 
(network id = 192.168.1.0 and broadcast id = 192.168.1.255)

For 192.168.1.0 /28, then network id = 192.168.1.0 and broadcast id = 192.168.1.15 as the total number of host is 16 but the available host we can use is only 14.

For 192.168.1.16 /28, then network id = 192.168.1.16 and broadcast id = 192.168.1.31 still having 16 total host.  

For 192.168.0.0 /23, the subnet would be 255.255.254.0,  the number of available host is 510,network id will be 192.168.0.0 and the broadcast id will be 192.168.1.255, the 1 represents a new network so basically it is 256 + 256  = 510 + 2 host
