# TCP
TCP stands for transmission control protocol. A connection Oriented Protocol with high reliability (https, ssh) connecting online as a 3 way hand shake and exist in [[Transport Layer]]. This is responsible for sending reliably [[Packets]] of data, and when it fails, it will resends again. 

THis is used only for one to one communication meaning an exchange of data from a single network device to another single network device

The process simply look like --> SYN > SYN ACK > ACK which basically request to connect to a certain port. A good way to visualize this is by using 
wire shark...

Here, we tried to connect to port 443. Also, TCP and UDP both exist in layer 4 which is the [[transport layer]]. 

TCP could be accessed by using command `netstat` in terminal

# UDP

Stands for user datagram protocol or connectionless transport layer protocol. Basically, this works even offline.
Because this is connectionless, this doesn't really ensure that the message are delivered. And worst, once the [[Packets]] are placed in the network by [[IP Address|IP Protocol]], it just forgets it. If the message failed to arrive, there is a change that it won't resend again. 

An example of [[Application Layer]] protocl that uses this is the [[Domain Name Server|DNS]]

THis is used only for broadcast communication in contrast to TCP.
