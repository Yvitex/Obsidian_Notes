# TCP

TCP stands for transmission control protocol. A connection Oriented Protocol with high reliability (https, ssh) connecting online as a 3 way hand shake. 
The process simply look like --> SYN > SYN ACK > ACK which basically request to connect to a certain port. A good way to visualize this is by using 
wire shark...

Here, we tried to connect to port 443. Also, TCP and UDP both exist in layer 4 which is the transmission layer. 


# UDP

Stands for user datagram protocol or connectionless protocol. Basically, this works even offline.
