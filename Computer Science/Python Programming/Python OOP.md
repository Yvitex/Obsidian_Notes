# Python OOP
The basic structure of object oriented programming is like the same as [[OOP]] of java
we first create the class
```python
class Something
```

Then the constructor
```python
class Something:
	def __init__(self):
		
```

Attributes have an alternative `this` keyword which is `self.`
```python
class Something:
	def __init__(self):
		self.color = "red"
```

Methods are created like this
```python
class Something:
	def __init__(self):
		self.color = "red"


	def change_color(self):
		self.color = "blue"
```
