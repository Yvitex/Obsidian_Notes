This is automatically generated using
```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

There you could see this
```json
"scripts": {
	"start": "react-scripts start",
	"build": "react-scripts build",
	"test": "react-scripts test",
	"eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```

This are the list of commands offer to us using [[NPM]]
```shell
$ npm start
```

The rest contains the dependencies we need to use such as [[React]] itself and [[DOM]]
The command start will run a local host network.
The command built will condense your code into a single file to make it more efficient
The command test will make test. 
The command eject will allow you to modify [[Babel]] and [[Webpack]]

We may also notice a package json lock thing, this is just a way of the [[NPM]] to make sure that developers in a group are using the same dependencies. When using YARN, this is not needed because they will use its own yarn -lock
