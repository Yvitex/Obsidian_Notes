# AutoCad Properties
A way to assign colors and line types to objects.![[Pasted image 20220919104708.png]]
Properties palette where all setting about the property is located, could be invoked through 3 different ways, first is by command PR, second is ctrl+1, click properties panel in the hometab. You also need to select the object you want to change properties but if there is none, then the default would be from [[AutoCad Layer|ByLayer]] to Red,  and UCS or Universal Coordinate System would be off. 

Properties of selected object could be viewed in the Properties palette and whehn an object has a layer, then the default would be ByLayer.

The color, lineweight and linetype. 
- Lineweight - Thickness of line, turn it off if irritating.

- Linetype  - dash line, need to load first before use. Also find the global scale factor to modify the scaling or the distance of gap and line![[Pasted image 20220919111237.png]]


If you want to copy a property of one object to another, then use the Match Properties Tool Command using MA or MATCHPROP.
