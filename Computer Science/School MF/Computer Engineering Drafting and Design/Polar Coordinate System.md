# Polar Coordinate System
Polar coordiantes have these thing called poles wherein it is the reference point to where our coordinates will start counting from. 

Polar coordinates radial distance and degree with this formula $$R<Degree$$
- R is the radial distance
- Degree is the value of angle in degrees, counted by counterclockwise from the x axis

In [[AutoCAD]], if we create a line using comman L, the input coordiantes like (1, 1 ) and (@5 <45), it will create a line that extends from (1, 1) to `idunno`. It depends

What just happened is that we create a point using an [[Absolute Coordinate System]] at (1, 1) and then we set that point as a pole and using the [[Relative Coordinate System]] command @,
We create a line with the length of 5 and rotate if 45 degrees counterclockwise from the x axis. 

The command we use is (@R<Degrees)
