# Relative Coordinate System
Is a coordinate system wherein  we do not start from the origin (0, 0) but base on the previous vertex of point we created. 

In [[AutoCAD]], if we create a line using comman L, the input coordiantes like (1, 1 ) and (@1, 1), it will create a line that extends from (1, 1) to (2, 2) base on the origin.

The command must have @ before the coordinates
