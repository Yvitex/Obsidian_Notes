# Blade Server
Designed to save more space than [[Rack Mount]] server. This is a [[Server Computer]] in a single card that can be mounted alongide other blade server to form a blade chassis. 
A blade chassis fits 6 or more servers. 

The benefits here is:
- We don't need separate power supply, the blade enclosure provides it
- Provides [[KVM Switch]], can control the server using a single monitor and keyboard.
- Reduce cable clutter, a single cable can service all server in enclosure.
