# 2 Types of element in electronic circuit

1. Active Element - can generates energy or control the flow of electrons (battery, generator, [[amplifier]], [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor|MOSFET]], [[Junction Field Effect Transistor|JFET]], [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|BJT]])
2. Passive Element- cannot generate energy (resistor, inductor, [[inductor]])


Active elements are mostly voltage and current source and there are [[2 Types of Electronic Sources]]
