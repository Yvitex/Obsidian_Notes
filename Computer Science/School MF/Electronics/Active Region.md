# What is a Active Region
In this state, the transistor is Active.

In simple terms, the [[Voltage|potential]] of the base is greater than the potential of [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|emitter]] but less than  the potential of [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|collector]]

## Mathematically
$$V_C >V_B > V_E$$

In [[Voltage Relationships in BJT|V_BE]] the value is greater than or equal 0.6

It is a saturation region if the [[2 Types of Electronic Sources|voltage source]] is greater than the difference of Voltage colelctor and emitter and is not zero 
$$0 < V_{CE} < V_{CC}$$
Alternatively: $$0 < I_C < I_S$$
I think this equation represents a [[Amplification|midpoint bias]].

## Diagram

As we can see on the diagram, the [[Voltage]] of the collector is the highest so the [[Electrons]] go there but the oppposite happens to the [[Electric Current]]

In here, when base current increase, the collector current increase.
