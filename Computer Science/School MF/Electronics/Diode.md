- Anode is the positive region of the diode
- Cathode is the negative region of the diode

Diode is the combination of [[Doping|P-type semiconductor]] and [[Doping|N-type semiconductor]] 

## In a Circuit
Remember that in a circuit,if the [[2 Types of Electronic Sources|Voltage Source]] polarities matched the diode, then it is in [[Forward Bias]]. Current will flow if this is the case.

If the negative polarity is connected to the anode, then it is in the [[Reverse bias]]. At this rate, current will flow.

Interaction between the p and n type semiconductor creates a junction called [[P-N Junction]] creating what we call a depletion region.
