# Field Effect Transistor
3 terminal transistor. Similar to [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]] but with some differences. The **field effect** is developed by the [[Charge Carriers|charge]] present and the one that controls the flow of current

- BJT has Collector(C), FET has drain(D)
- BJT has base(B), FET has gate(G)
- BJT has emitter(E), FET has source(S)

Each of there equivalence has the same application

## Other comparisons
- BJT is current controlled, FET is voltage controlled
- BJT is bipolar(holes and electron) while FET is unipolar(holes or electron)
- If FET depends on electron, it is called n-channel
- If FET depends on holes, it is called p-channel

## Types
1. [[Junction Field Effect Transistor|JFET]]
2. [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor|MOSFET]]
