# What is Kirchoff's Current Law
This states that the algebraic some of the current, leaving and entering the node is 0

## Mathematical Formula
$$\sum_{n=1}^Ni_n = 0$$
N = number of branches connected to the node
n = nth current entering or leaving the [[Network Topology Branches|Node]]


This shows it has a similar behavior like [[Kirchoff's Voltage Law|KVL]] where the sum of voltage in a loop is equals to zero.

## Signs to be used
- if current entering the node (+)
- if current is leaving the node (-)
- it can be vise versa


### Example 1

##### The formula here is:
$$i_1 - i_2 + i_3 +i_4 - i_5 = 0$$
This formula also proves that the current entering the node is equal the current leaving the node.

### Example 2

##### Formula:
$$I_T = I_1 - I_2 + I_3$$

This formula concede to the [[Law of Conservation of Charge]].

Note that [[Electric Charge]] and [[Energy]] are not the same so [[Law of Conservation of Energy]] is different to [[Law of Conservation of Charge]] but still the behavior is quite the same.
