# What is Ohm's law
<blockquote >Ohmâ€™s Law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional the current I flowing through the resistor. <cite>--the internet</cite></blockquote>

Ohms law states the relationship between [[Voltage]], [[Electric Current ]]and [[Resistance]]

## Mathematical formula# $$v = iR$$
