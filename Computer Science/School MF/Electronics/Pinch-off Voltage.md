# Pinch off Voltage
Usually happens in a [[Field Effect Transistor]], where [[Voltage]] increase ($V_{DS}\uparrow$) do not affect [[Electric Current|Current]] strength ($I_D$), The same thing occurs at [[Saturation Region]] in a [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|BJT]], where $I_B$ may increase but not $I_C$
