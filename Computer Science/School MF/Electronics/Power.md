# What is power?

Rate of expending or absorving [[Work|energy]] measured in watts


## Math formula

Power is calculated by the [[Derivatives]] of energy or work over time.

Combining the formula for[[ Voltage ]]and  [[Electric Current|current]] we will also get power as the result such as:

The equation above is called **instantaneous power**

Power dissipated can be determined by [[Resistance]]
 $$p = iv = \frac{v^2}{R} = i^2R$$
## Signs to be used
- If power is absobed, (+)
- if power is delivered or supplied,(-)

We could also identify it using a diagram
- if [[Electric Current|current]] goes to the positive pole/terminal of source [[Voltage]], (+) - absorving
- if current goes to the negative pole of source voltage, (-) - supply
