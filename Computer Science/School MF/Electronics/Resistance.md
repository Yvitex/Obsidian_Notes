# What is resistance?

Resistance is the ability tor esist [[Electric Current]]

This is represented by the symbol R with the unit of ohms

## Mathematical Formula
 $$R= p \frac{l}{A}$$
- R = resistance
- p = [[Resistivity of common Material]]- material's resistance in ohm/meter
- l = length - length of the material ([[Conductors are material composed of unstable atoms|conductor]], [[Insulator|insulator]], [[Semi-conductor]])
- A = Area - area of the cross section

The inverse of resistance is called [[Conductance]]
