# What is a Semiconductor?
- A solid material that has a [[Conductance|conductivity]] between an [[Insulator|insulators]] and that of [[Conductors are material composed of unstable atoms|conductor]]

## Common Semiconductor 
- [[Silicon]] 
- [[Gallium Arsenide]]
- [[Selenium]]
- [[Germanium]]
- [[Metal Oxides]]

For Semiconductor to be useful, we usually add an [[Impurities]] to the equation.
Addition of impurity to a semiconductor is called [[Doping]]
