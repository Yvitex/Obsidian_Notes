We could see here that the BJT circuit is still present, now with 2 aditional resistor and 2 [[Capacitor]]
To solve this kind of diagram, we will use this formula

## Formula
$$I_B = \frac{V_{CC} x \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} -V_{BE}}{\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2} + \big(\beta + 1 \big)R_E }$$

[[Capacitor]] in this diagram filters the [[Electric Current|Current]] where spikes will become curved and triangles will become sinusoidal.
