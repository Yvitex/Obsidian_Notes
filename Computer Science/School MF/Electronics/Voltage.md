# What is voltage?

Voltage or **electromotive force** also called as **potential difference** is a force that push electrons charge to create an [[Electric Current]]. 

Mathematically:

where dw is the [[Numerical Differentiation and Integration|derivatives]] of [[Work]] and over [[Basic Unit of Electric Circuit is Electric Charge|charge]]

The resulting unit will be Joules/Coulombs == Volts

The direction of voltage could change the sign of the voltage

Still, they are equal

Remember that [[Electric Current|Current]] flows from highest potential to the lower potential. Reverse motion of the [[Electron Flow]]
