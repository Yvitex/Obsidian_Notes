# Binary - Decimal Conversion
Binary are also [[Positional Value System]] numbers meaning we could perform [[Reading the Binary]] to [[Decimal Number System]]

We could also do the inverse:
To convert a number like 43 to binary, we could divide it by to and the reminder will become the binary
| Operation | Result | Reminder |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 43 / 2    | 21     | 1        |
| 21 / 2    | 10     | 1        |
| 10 / 2    | 5      | 0        |
| 5 / 2     | 2      | 1        |
| 2 / 2     | 1      | 0        |
| 1 / 2     |        | 1         |

Because we can't divide 1 by 2, we just made the rest a reminder
The binary equivalent is read from bottom to top as we know that the [[Least Significant Bit]] is a lower number and is located to the right so the conversion is $101011_2$
