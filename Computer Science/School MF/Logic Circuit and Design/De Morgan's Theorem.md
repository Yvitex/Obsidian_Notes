# De Morgan's Theorem
This law works based on the concept of Duality. Duality means in De morgan's law context is about interchanging values and operations such as when the value is 0, we replace it by 1 and vice versa, or we replace an [[AND gate]] with an [[OR gate]] then vice versa.

The first rule in this law is that:
The compliment of the product of 2 variables is equal to the sum of the compliment of the variables.
$$(A.B)' = A' + B'$$

The second rule is that:
The compliment of the sum of 2 variables is equal to the product of the compliment of that 2 variables
$$(A+B)' = A' . B'$$
