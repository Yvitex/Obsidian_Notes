# Decimal Number System
Is the most common [[Number system]] used in many fields like mathematics. It is a base 10 number system composed of number from 0 to 9. 

Digital Number System can be represented through [[Positional Value System]] meaning that the value of a number depends on its poistion, thic could be once, tenths, hundreths, and thousanths. 

For exampel the value of 7 in 732 and 172 is different, one is 700 (7 x 10 ^ 2) and another with 70 (7 x 10).

Having 10 different values or numbers in a [[Digital System]] are difficult. So we create other suitable [[Number system]] such as [[Binary|Binary Number System]]

It will look like this $322_{10}$
