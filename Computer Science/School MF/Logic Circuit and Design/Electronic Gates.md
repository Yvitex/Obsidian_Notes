# Electronic Gates
Electronic gates, of course require Power or [[Voltage]]. 

In [[Boolean Algebra]], there are 2 rules to be considered:
- The input of a gate could be 0 or 5v which is equivalent to 0 and 1
- The output of a gate could be 0 or 5V which is equivalent to 0 and 1, though there is only one output in a electronic gate, the input could have 2 or more.

Remember that there is always a ==time delay== between the input being applied and the output responding.
