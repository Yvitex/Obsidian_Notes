# Hexadecimal - Decimal Conversion
If we have this number in hexadecimal or base 16, $$27FB_{16}$$
We could convert it by:
$$2×163 + 7×162 + 15×161 + 10×160 = 10234_{10}$$


We could also convert it from [[Decimal Number System]] to Hex
For example: $423_{10}$
| Operation | Result | Reminder |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 423 / 16  | 26     |    7     |
| 26 / 16   | 1      |     A     |
| 1 / 16    |        | 1         |

The equivalent is ready from bottom to top, so the answer is $1A7_{16}$
