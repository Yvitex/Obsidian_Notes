# Logic Gate
Logic gate is the logic used by electronic gates that transforms the input into a proper output. Here are the list of combinator in a logic gate:
- [[AND gate]]
- [[OR gate]]
- [[NOT gate]]
- [[NAND gate]]
- [[NOR gate ]]
- [[EXOR gate]] 
- [[EXNOR gate ]]

[[NAND gate]] and [[NOR gate]] are _Universal functions_ since it used both [[AND gate]] or [[OR gate]] and the [[NOT gate]].

```ad-Danger
title: EXOR and EXNOR
collapse: open
It is not EOR, it is [[EXOR gate]] and it is not ENOR, it is [[EXNOR gate]].

```


Here is a piece of note:
Function in [[Converting Truth Tables to Boolean Expression]] form can be implemented by replacing all [[AND gate]] and [[OR gate]] with [[NAND gate]]

We could also implement the function in [[Converting Truth Tables to Boolean Expression]] form by replacing all [[AND gate]] and [[OR gate]] with [[NOR gate]].
