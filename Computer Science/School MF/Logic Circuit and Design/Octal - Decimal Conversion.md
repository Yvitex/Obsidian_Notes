# Octal - Decimal Conversion
We could convert it to [[Decimal Number System]] simply through the use of [[Positional Value System]] calculation 

Example using $726_8$
$(7 * 8 ^2) + (2 * 8 ^1) + (6 * 8 ^ 0) =  448 + 16 + 6 = 470$

We could also convert [[Decimal Number System]] to octal by dividing it with 8 and the reminder would be the equivalent
$473_{10}$
| Operation | Answer | Reminder |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 473 / 8   | 59     | 1        |
| 59 / 8    | 7      | 3        |
| 7 / 8     |        | 7         |

We read it from buttom to top, so the converted value is $731_{8}$
