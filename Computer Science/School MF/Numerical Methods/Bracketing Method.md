# Bracketing Method
This method requires 2 initial guesses, or brackets to find the roots.

![[Pasted image 20220922151648.png]]

Depending on these 2 initial guess, we may or may not find the roots. See the picture above, the 2 red lines forming the shade is the bracket. The 2 brackets have not sign change therefore the roots are not here. If the brackets have a sign change then the roots are located in here. 

We have several diverging techniques under it:
- [[Graphical Method]]
- [[Incremental Search Method]]
- [[Bisection Method]]
-
