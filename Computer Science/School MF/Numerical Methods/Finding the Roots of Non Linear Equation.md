# Finding the Roots of Non Linear Equation
Our goal is to find the roots of [[Transcendental Functions]] and [[Polynomial Function]]. Roots are basically what will make the x = 0, and we could get these roots basically by using [[Quadratic Formula]]

We have different techniques to do this but take note that the results could be either [[Real Number]] or [[Complex Number]]. 

So first we have the technique called the [[Bracketing Method]]
