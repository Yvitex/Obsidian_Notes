# Numerical Methods and Analysis
The study of [[Algorithm]] and methods  or implementation with the help of mathematical theory that supports them.

This is the reverse of [[Analytical Method]], analytical method creates exact values, while numerical method is only approximates.

Here are the following activities that is required to do Numerical Computing
- [[Algebraic and Transcendal Equation]]
- [[Interpolation]]
- [[Curve Fitting]]
- [[Differential Equation]]
- [[Integral Equation]]

There are some problem in using Numerical Methods and our role is to find a solution that solves:
- Inaccuracy - calculations often does not yield the correct answer.
- Efficiency - time of algorithm to execute.
- Stability - same input produce same output

Numerical methods are built different. Why? Numerical solutions are only used at certain selected or discrete solution points and they are trial and error processes, they yield in accurate results which is why they are need to be estimated using selected increments. 

There are 2 types of error in numerical method that we need to be aware of:
- [[Truncation Error]]
- [[Round-off Error]]
