# System of Linear Equations
This is a collection of Linear Equation in which variables are of the same of value. There are multiple methods on finding the value of the variables including:
### Direct
- [[Gaussian Elimination]]

### Iterative
- [[Gauss Jacobi]]
- [[Gauss Seidel]]

A technique in excel we could do. We just need to cnvert it to an equal matrix like 3 by 3, separated from the result. Invert the value of the matrix using the Minverse function and press ctrl shift enter. 

The result will then be use to multiply in the y result column using MMult function. Press ctrl shift enter and see the result.
