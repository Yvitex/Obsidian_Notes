# Scope Management
This is the scope of the project which defines all the activity that must be done during [[Software Development]] to make a product

This creates the boundary of what should be done and what is not included which in turns reduce the cost and time overrun

Here what we do is to:
- Define the Scope
-  Verify the Scope
- Control the scope
- Decide the verification and control
- Divide project into various small parts
