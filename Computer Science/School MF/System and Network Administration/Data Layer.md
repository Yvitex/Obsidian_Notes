# Data Layer
This is the layer where meaning are assigned to the [[Bit]]s tranmitted in a network, this layer is reponsible for the size of the [[Packets]] or data to be sent, a way to address the network so that the data was received by the correct recipient and a way to ensure that no 2 or more data will be tranmitted on the network at the same time and even ensure that the the data sent is the data received or accurate.

This is also responsible for [[Data Framing]] and flow control. Sends one [[Packets]] between two host. 

In Data Link Layer, we ensure that the recipient is correct using a special address called [[MAC Address]]

To prevent devices from sending data over the network at the same time, we use a technique called [[CSMA with CD]]
