[[Network Standard]] for [[Ethernet]] is often constructed at this form, where the number indicates the speed, 10, 100 or 1000 mbps. Base is a short word for [[Baseband]] which is a type of [[Network transmission]]. The tail indicates the cable type, number are represented to indicate the maximum length of that cable, like for [[10Base5]] could rn to  500 meters, [[Coaxial|10Base2]] for 185 meter.
