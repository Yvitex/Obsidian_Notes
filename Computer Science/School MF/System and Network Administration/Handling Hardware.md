## Handling Hardware
To be a system administrator, we need to handle the hardware with care.
- All electronic equipment should be treated as highly fragile and easily damaged, regardless of how sturdy it is.
- Never insert or remove power cords from equipment without ensuring that it is switched off.
- Take care when inserting multi-pin connectors that the pins are oriented the right way up and that no pins are bent on insertion
