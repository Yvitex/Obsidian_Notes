# Network Interface Card
Are a very important part of a [[Network]], in fact, a [[Server Computer]] or a [[Client Computer]] won't be part of a network without it. This is an expansion card that enable the computer to be a part of the network.

Almost all NIC concede for the [[Networking]] standard called [[Ethernet]], therefore in order to connect to the network, we need an [[Ethernet]] cable with [[RJ-45 Port]] connector.

Modern computers do not need a separate NIC as they are already built in or the motherboard has an ethernet support like [[RJ-45 Port]]
