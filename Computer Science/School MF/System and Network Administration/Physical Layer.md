# Physical Layer
Address the physical characteristic of the network such as cable types, cable length etc. [[Network Topologies]] are also belong to the physical layer. This defines the electrical characteristic to [[Binary]] values. 

It is also responsible in moving information using physical medium. Specifies one bit, their encoding scheme, voltage level etc. 

Some Physical Layer devices include the following:
- [[Repeaters]] - bypass physical layer standard in cable length
- [[Multiport Repeater]]
- [[Network Interface Card]]
