# Protocol Suites
 Are matches of protocols, one of the most popular protocol suites is the [[TCP and UDP|TCP]]/[[IP Address|IP]] and [[IPX]]/[[SPX]]. The difference is that [[TCP and UDP|TCP]]/IP is orginally for [[UNIX]] and internet [[Network Protocol]], IPX/SPX is used by NetWares and some window networks.

The third important protocol is the [[Ethernet]].

## TCP/IP

It have the Network Interface Layer and the Network, Transport and Application layer similar to [[OSI Model]]. 
Network interface layer covers the [[Physical Layer]] and [[Data Layer]] with famous [[Network Protocol]] such as [[Ethernet]] and Token Ring, [[Network Layer]] is for network layer as well as for the [[Transport Layer]] and Application Layer is composed of the upper 3 layers of osi. 


## IPX/SPX

Is not created by [[Network Standard]] group but rather owned by Novell that's why it was called NWLink, IPX/SPX Compatible Protocol, or NWLINK IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol. rather than ipx/spx itself
