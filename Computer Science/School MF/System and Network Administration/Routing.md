This comes to play when a device needs to send [[Packets]] to a computer in another network. Router is a device used to forward these [[Packets]] to the other network, at some cases this will travel to some intermediate network.

```ad-Attention

If the protocol uses an address that include network part and host part, it is routable, physical address like the [[MAC Address]] is not routable
