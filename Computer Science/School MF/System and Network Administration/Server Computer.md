# Server Computer
Computers that provides resources in a [[Network]], these have specialized [[Operating System]] called [[Network Operating System]]

They may also contain specialized Software like [[Apache Web Server]] and [[Microsoft Exchange]]

Server is any computer that contains the resources such as hard drives, printer etc that is shared in a [[Network]], they provide the sharing of resources the [[Network]] uses such as [[Databases|database]], email, web services etc.

Any computer could act as a server, but there is a special kind of computer that is only specialized for it and they are called [[Dedicated Server]]

## Server Computer Requirement
These are some important things to keep in mind when picking a server:
- [[Scalability]] - increase the size and capacity of the server computer. Do not buy a server that only met you needs because it will double the next year. Buy [[Random Access Memory|ram]] and processor more powerful than you need
- Reliability - what you get is what you pay, some low priced server computer are often a fake and inferior build. This is important cos when this fait, all [[Client Computer]] in the network is affected
- Availability - when the computer fail. how long does it take to make the server run again, some server are hot swappable meaning some components are easily replacable without shutting the server. Meaning what we focus here is the downtime.
- Service and support - when the server computer fails, is there someone available and qualified to repair it? Don't take it to a repair shop or repair facility, we need the server running again as fast as we could.

## Component of Server Computer

- [[Motherboard]]
- [[Processor]] - most people think about this first when it comes to computer server. Server computer should have Itanium 2 or Xeon processor and the likes like AMD. Some server have 2 or more socket for processor. Pentium 4 and celeron processor form Intel should only be used in desktop or notebook computer
- [[Random Access Memory|Memory]] - choose a memory that is supported by the [[Motherboard]]. Most server could handle 12 to 32 gb of memory
- Hard Drives - desktop uses [[Advance Technology Attachment|ATA]] or [[Advance Technology Attachment|IDE Drives]], servers uses [[SCSI]] for performances
- Network connection - important part, luckily, most server have a builtin [[Network Interface Card|Network Adapter]], if not, need to add separate [[Network Interface Card]].
- Video - use generic video cards, not important
- Power supply - this requires a large power supply, 300 watts and above depending on the amount of hard drives.

## Form Factor

Another thing to be discussed in a server computer is the form factor. Form factor is simply the size, shape and packaging of the hardware.
- [[Tower Case]]
- [[Rack Mount]]
- [[Blade Server]]
