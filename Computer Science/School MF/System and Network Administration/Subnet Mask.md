# Subnet Mask
Subnet mask is like [[IP Address]] but only it used internally within a specific network. We use subnet mask to tell the [[Packets]] where to go. They are in the form of 255.255.255.255, 4 numerical numbers indicating [[Binary]] data or 8 [[Bit]]s. For an [[IP Address]] of 192.0.15.12 class C network, it is only actually 192.0.15.0 /24 and its subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, 0 is the modifiable number while the others are constant and unchanging.

Subnet is primarily a network inside a [[Network]]. It is a logical subdivision that organize an [[IP Address|IP]] network.

Subnet would makes network [[Traffic]] or request more efficient by finding and traveling to the shortest distance without passing to unecesary routers to reach its destination.

Subnets will also use [[IP Address]] which is read by the computer as [[Binary]] but read by humans as [[Alpha Numeric Codes]]. This narrows down the [[IP Address]] based on the range of devices.

To organize a network so that [[Traffic]]s could find the right path, we use different [[Subnetting]] techniques.
