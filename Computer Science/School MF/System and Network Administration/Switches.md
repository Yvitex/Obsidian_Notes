Computers do not directly connect to the [[Network]] using [[Cables]] but rather to a device called switches. Switches may contain 8 or 16 ports, if they have 8 ports, then we could connect 8 computers through it to the [[Network]]

So  simply, switches are devices that direct traffic around [[Local Area Network]]. 
Switches talk to the Level of Ethernet or [[Data Layer|Layer 2]] protocol
