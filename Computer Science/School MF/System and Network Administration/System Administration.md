# System Administration
This is an adminstriation that solves the problem of the user in order to produce work using a [[System]]

another definition defines it by Unix Dev and Mainframe Engineers to describe if a computer is coupled by a [[Network]] or not. 

On my understanding, maybe like biological system where one organ is cooperating with one another creating a system of life. It's the same but aside from biological parts, they are computers interacting with one another using the power of itnernet.

The role of humans in the system administration is a balancing act, they need to fix the instrument when it fails and diagnose it as said in the [[Human-Computer System Administration]]
