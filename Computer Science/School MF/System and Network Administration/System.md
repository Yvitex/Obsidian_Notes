Yup, the system once again. System is an organized effort to fulfill a goal or at least create some predictable behavior. 

It could be a group of humans working on a project, or a group of computers running the [[Public Ledger|Blockchain]]. Yes, block chain is a system too. 

The key note to take is that it is a collboration activity between different actors or entity.
