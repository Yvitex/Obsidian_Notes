# Transport Layer
This involves one of the pairs in the [[Protocol Suites]]. So if the [[Network Protocol]] of the [[Network Layer]] is [[IP Address|IP]], then its partner should be [[TCP and UDP|TCP]], if it is [[IPX]] then it is partnered with SPX. This layer's priority is the correct transportation of information from one computer to another, this involves resending packets that are corrupted or not received etc. 

One of its main role is the division of data into smaller [[Packets]] which will be reassembled in this layer.

Instead of using [[TCP and UDP|TCP]] that ensures reliability, we could use [[TCP and UDP|UDP]] instead which is a connectionless protocol that prioritize speed and efficiency.
