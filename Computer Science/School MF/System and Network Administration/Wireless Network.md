# Wireless Network
Wireless network is a replacement for [[Cables]] and [[Switches]] or any physical links. They work through the use of radio signals with such equipment such as Radio Transmitter and Receiver. 

Like any other things, it have its advantage and disadvantages. The advantage is that it is more flexible, it don't need wires but the main disadvatage is that it is less secure than your typical [[Cables]]
