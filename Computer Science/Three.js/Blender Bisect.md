# Blender Bisect
We could cut meshes however we want using the Bisect Command. ![[Pasted image 20220919151948.png]]

Go to edit mode and search for bisect through f3. Slide through the mesh and set this setting

Tick the fill and the clear outer to clean out the separated mesh. ![[Pasted image 20220919152145.png]]
Remember that everytime we do a bisect, we will select all vertices.
