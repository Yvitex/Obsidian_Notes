# What is Field of View?
A vertical vision angle that specify the scope of the view. The higher the value, the higher the scope though some [[Three.js Objects|object]] in the [[Three.js Scene|scene]] might appear streched in the process.

Basically the higher te value we set, the wider we could see, the lower it is, the smaller the scope it could render.

We specify this in degree angle.
