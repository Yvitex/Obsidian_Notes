# HTML Canvas
An [[HTML]] markdown where we can put various stuff such as 3d models or graphics


## For Three.js Canvas
Inside HTML, we need to create a canvas where we can [[WebGL Renderer|render]] the [[Three.js Scene|scene]] inside the webpage.

`<canvas class="webgl"></canvas>`

Here, the renderer we use is called [[WebGL Renderer]], but we can specify a different name, it's your choice.
