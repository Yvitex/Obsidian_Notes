# Ways to import Image File
There are 2 ways that we could import image into a [[Javascript]] source code easilty.

## Using the Path
We could import it like this
```js
import image from "../data/pictures/image.jpeg"
```


## Using Static Folder
Using the static folder, we do not need to go out of the path and product a long string of address to access it. It will automatically get the files in the statif folder by simply specifying its name
```js
import image from "image.jpeg"
```

This is just another way ot [[Importing in Javascript]]
