# Constrains
Just like any other constrains which creates constrains between 2 bodies
- ==HingeConstraint== - acts as the door constraint or having a pivot for rotation
- ==DistanceConstraint== - force bodies to keep distance against each other
- ==LockConstraint== - merge bodies as if they are one piece
- ==PointToPointConstraint== -glues the body to a specific point
