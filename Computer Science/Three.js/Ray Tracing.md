# Ray Tracing
IS a technique to make a realistic models or scene in 3d softwares like blender. Light bounces, some colors reflect the color of other objects because of it and to reproduce the exact same phenomenon in the real world, we use this technique.

We will send a lot of rays from a specific point to different direction and when this ray collides with other object, then we will reflect the color of that object, for example the red floor to the white sphere.
