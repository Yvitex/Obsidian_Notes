# Shaders
First of, we must understand some concepts. Shaders will be written on [[GLSL]].
Also, we do not send information to the pixel but rather the correct term to say is "[[Fragments]]"

The data we send to the shaders:
- Vertices Coordinate
- Mesh Transformation
- Information about the camera
- Colors
- Textures
- Light 
- Fog
- And many more

## 2 Types of Shader
- [[Vertex Shader]] 
- [[Fragment Shader]]

We could [[Create Shaders in Three.js]]
