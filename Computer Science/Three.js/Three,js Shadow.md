# Shadow
Casting shadow in [[Three.js (core)]] is very simple. We just need to tweak 4 properties.
Three js shadows are enabled by shadow map, shadow map is simply a texture of a shadow generated by the camera.

There are 4 types of shadow here:
- Basic Shadow Map
- PCF Shadow Map (default)
- PCF Soft Shadow Map
- VSM Shadow Map

First is to enable the shadowmap in the [[WebGL Renderer|renderer]]
```js
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
	canvas: canvas
})

renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
```

The next thing to do is to enable the shadow of a [[Three.js Mesh|mesh]]  through `castShadow`
```js
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(sphereGeometry, material)
mesh.castShadow = true;
```

Next is to enable the receving mesh the shadow
```js
const plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeometry, material)
plane.receiveShadow = true;
```

In this point forward, we will have different method for different [[Three.js Light]] source.
- [[Directional Light Shadow]]
- [[Spot Light Shadow]]
- [[Point Light Shadow]]
- [[Shadow Baking]]


What to use? It depends on you, but I prefer shadow baking because it is easier though it have textures to load.
