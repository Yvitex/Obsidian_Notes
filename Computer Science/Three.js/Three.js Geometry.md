# What is Three.js Geometry?

A figure or a shape we create as a [[Three.js Mesh|mesh]] property


## Basic Cube Geometry
Three.js already has a specified class in creating a cube called **BoxGeometry** and we will just need to create a copy of it

`const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)`

The parameters we use is the x, y, z size of the geometry
