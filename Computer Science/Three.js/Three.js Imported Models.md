# Imported Models
In a complex models we must use a 3d model created from a different source such as blender
There are many different kind of 3d formats you could find in 3d models, we could refer to the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:3D_graphics_file_formats) to know but the most standard format is called [[GLTF]]

- [[GLTFLoader()]]
- [[DracoLoader()]]

We could also have an [[Animation for Imported Models]]
