# Materials
In this, we specify the [[Three.js Mesh|mesh]] properties such as color, texture etc?

### Specifying a Color
To specify a color, we instantiate the **MeshBasicMaterial**

`const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 'red'})`

Parameters inside the Three.js class contains a js.object as we have many properties we could add. Colors can also be in [[Hexadecimal Notation]]
