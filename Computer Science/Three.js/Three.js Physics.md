# Physics
We should libraries to make our lives more easier than ever, like heck, why not work smart rather working your butt hard? Why not reuse when you could rather than wasting time which equates to gold?

The theory is simple, not. We create 2 worlds. one is the three.js world and the other is the physics world. We let the physics world update by itself then we take the coordiante from each frame in the physics world and apply it to  [[Three.js (core)]] world coordinates. 

Even through three js is 3d, we could also use 2d physics libraries just like in this [game website](http://letsplay.ouigo.com/), here are the list of libraries we could use

## 3d Libraries
- Ammo.js (most used)
- [[Cannon.js]] (easier)
- Oimo.js
- Physi.js (easiest but less control)

## 2d Libraries
- Matter.js
- P2.js
- Planck.js
- Box2D.js
