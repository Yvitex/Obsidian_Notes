# Transforming an Object
In three.js, we could modify the object's [[Position (Three.js)|position]], scale and rotation.

- [[Position (Three.js)]]
- [[Rotation (Three.js)]]
- [[Scale (Three.js)]]
- Quarternion

All objects inherits from Object3D such as [[Three.js Camera]] and [[Three.js Mesh]] have all of this 4 properties that can  be modified. 

Distance or values withing each properties is completely arbitrary or random, solely based on user's whim.

This properties will be compiled in [[Matrices]]

We can do this by specifying the x, y,  z values.
- X = horizontal component
- Y = vertical component
- Z = forward and backward component
