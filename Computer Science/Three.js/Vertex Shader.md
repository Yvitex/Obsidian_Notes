# Vertex Shader
Vertex shaders position each vertex of the geometry![[Pasted image 20220831043318.png]]
Take note that these are just theoretical position.
There are 2 kinds of data we could find in the code and they are;
- [[Shader Attributes]]
- [[Shader Uniform]]

Now that we have positioned the [[Three.js Geometry|vertices]] properly, the [[GPU]] will act to show what parts are visible

Then after that is we could build the [[Fragment Shader]]

[[Vertex Shader GLSL]]
