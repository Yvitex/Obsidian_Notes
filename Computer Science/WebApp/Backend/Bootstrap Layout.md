# Bootstrap Layout
The basic syntax is like
```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col col-sm-12"></div>
	</div>
</div>
```

The layout will occupy 12 columns in small screen and above. We could compound it also
```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-6"></div>
	</div>
</div>

```

Now, it would be halved in medium screen and above.
