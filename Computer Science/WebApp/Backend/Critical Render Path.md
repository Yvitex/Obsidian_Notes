# Critical Render Path
Critical render path is the path that the website takes to display something to the user.

One thing to note is that the browser won't render  if it founds a [[CSS]] link in the html and haven't found it yet

What we could do to reduce the load time is to reduce the [[CSS]] using [Minify CSS](https://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/)
as well as the [[Javascript]]
