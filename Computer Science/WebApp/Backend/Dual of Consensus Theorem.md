# Dual of Consensus Theorem

$$(A+B)(B+C)(A’+C) = (A+B)(A’+C)$$

A second method from [[Consensus Theorem]] where in we inverted the operations. Solutions are as follow:

We first multiply the first and second parenthesis in accordance to the [[Distributive Law]].

$$(AB + AC + BB+ BC)(A'+C)$$

B and B in [[And Law]] is equals to B

$$(AB + AC + B+ BC)(A'+C)$$

B or (B and C) will be dependent on variable B, if B is 0 then all of them is 0. SOO

$$(AB + AC + B)(A'+C)$$

The same goes to (A and B or B)

$$(B + AC)(A' + C)$$

 Perform the [[Distributive Law]]
 $$A'B + BC + AA'C + ACC$$
 
A and complement A is equals to 0. C and C is equals to C

$$A'B + BC + 0 + AC$$

There fore
$$A'B + BC + AC$$

Through [[Consensus Theorem]], we know that this equation wil result to 

$$AB+ĀC$$
