# What is an HTML?
It is an abbreviation of Hypertext Markup Language. It is a markup language that I use in writing my notes here in obsidian that provides content to a certain webpage, etc. Definitely more powerful than a simple text editor. 

## BoilerPlate
In Visual Studio, we can just type ! + tab for the boiler plate.
