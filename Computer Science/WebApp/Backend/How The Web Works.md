The first thing that occurs when we search for a website is that we request for the Address of that Domain Name  in the [[Domain Name Server]] through the [[Internet Service Provider]]
 The [[Domain Name Server|DNS]] will return an [[IP Adress]] that will be send to the browser. 

As soon as we get the [[IP Adress]], we will send the [[IP Adress]] to google server and returns a copy of [[HTML]] [[CSS]] and [[Javascript]]
