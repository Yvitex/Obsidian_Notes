# Javascript Object Notation
It looks like JSON but it is more generalized that it could be used in many programming languages. It is used to transfer information in the internet. 


In [[Javascript]], we have 2 functions that we could use to convert objects into json and json to objects and they are `stringify` and `parse`
- `json.stringify()` = will convert it into json
- `json.parse()` = will convert it into object
