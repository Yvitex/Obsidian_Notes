# What is a Database?

There are 2 types of database, SQL and [[NoSQl]]. The main difference between this 2 are their formatting, while SQL was organized like a table, NoSql was organized like a document similar to JSON formatting. NoSQL is more moden than SQL and is flexible to gather data in an irregular shape, as well as it is scalable compared to SQL but SQL is better when it comes to relationship. 

Remember to remember the CRUD operations. How to create, read, update and delete data. 



Note: Blockchain is also a databse, but a shared database not managed by a single server but multiple computers
