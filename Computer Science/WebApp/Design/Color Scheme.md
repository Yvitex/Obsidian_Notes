Here is a good resource in [canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) and [paletton](http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF) that will enable to choose a color palette effectively
There are several types of color scheme out there that have different effects
- Monochromatic
- Analogous
- Complementary
- Split Complementary
- Triadic


## Monologous

This is basically using one type of color with different hues, tint and brightness. This is used for simplistic designs. This has less distracting layout.

## Analogous

This color can be easily found in nature. This use 3 different colors that are besides each other

## Complementary

They are high contrasting color palette resulting a more vibrant color combination.

## Triadic

Forms an equilateral triangle.


Here is how you pick a color palette:
- Who are you designing for?
- What personality does the brand have?
- What does color means to you?

We tend to stop at red that maybe means danger to us, we say that green have a positive impact, we click on blue to go to a different webpage, we tend to read a exh in black before we go to lighter color such as grey.

In coloring you text, choose a tinted black or grey. Never go for a pure black nor pure grey.
