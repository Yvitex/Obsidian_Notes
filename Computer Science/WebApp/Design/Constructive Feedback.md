# Constructive Feedback
Good [[Feedback]] induced by cooperative people and good presentors. 

To get good feedbacks like this, here are the tips that we need to consider
## Tips
- Be clear and provide context - we need to define exactly in what part we are on the designing process, if you are in [[Sketching]], [[Sitemap]], [[Wireframe]]s or [[Prototyping]]
- Invite members ahead of time and provide quick introduction - such as sending a message about the meeting, time, the topics and goals.
- Invite only the people you need - doesn't need to be the CEO, but those who are knowledgeable in the certain topic. Like developers, or other designers, even the clients. Remember, less is better to reduce the noise. It needs to be the right people where you will receive the [[Feedback]]
- Put the attendees to work - all members must be involved, no one left aside, no one not participating


We could make people cooperate by: 
- [[Feedback]] generation - Put a board, make the members write on a sticky note on what topic they want to discuss, their questions or their feedbacks. 
- Vote -  make them vote on what topic needs to be prioritized.  
- Discuss - discuss the topics from the most relevant to the least according to votes
