# Design Patterns
Solution for designing and most of the time it was already solved and we just neet to reuse them for example. loggining in using fb.

## Types
- Data Input - like dragging and dropping info
- Content Structuring - the flow of the application and etc, we ensure it using [[User Flows]]
- Navigation - like structuring navigation bars
- Incentivation - like making a reward for any sucessful trannsaction
- Hierarchy - for example is [[Form Design]], we highlioght the primary button and lessen the opacity of buttons in secondary
- Social Media - sharing on social media.

For mobiles. we want to consider large buttons for accessibility and we must mind in what place is the users are able to tap effectively
