1. The planning phase - The first part of any development where we interact with the clients on how the product should work, their functionality and the user needs. Highly communicative part of developmnet
2. The design phase - where the deisgner use the information from the planning phase to implement how the product should feel for every user, to make the user's like more easier than ever.
3. The development phase - is where developer use the [[CSS]], [[HTML]] [[Javascript]] to create something from the design, to make it reality.
4. The launch phase - is where we launch our product to the web, some tweaking and testing is also implemented
5. The post-launch phase - we monitor how the launch goes, how the user interact with the system, fetch some problems and dissatisfaction from the customer and create a new plan to solve those problem.
6. The cycle repeats - we go back again from the planning phase. 


# Developer vs Designer
Designer usually handles the planning phase, the designing phase and the post launch phase of a product, while the developer are the ones that handles the actual construction or the development and the launch phase. 

Develooper also needs the knowledge of the designer and so is the designer knowledge with programming.
