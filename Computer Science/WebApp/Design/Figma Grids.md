We could add another layout for baseline [[Grids]]

## Rules
- *Make use of columns inside columns*, each container that contains small [[User Interface Basics|ui]] elements should have their own [[Grids]] that will estblish the consistency of the content

- *We allign elements with the columns and not the gutter*, this will create inconsistency in spacings and proper width

- Like we said before, utilize grid inside grids, each container have their own grids and the content adhere to their parent grids

- *Some things might not need to adhere with the grids*. Like hero images or oversized image
