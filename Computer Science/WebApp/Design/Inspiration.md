# Inspiration
Inspiration does not come out of our butt. There are ways to be inspired, here are the following:

- Talk to people... seriously talk to people. Everyone is intelligent, except for tiktokers, everyone have unique ideas and we could fetch datas from them. But of course, it depends on the topic
- Study other solution. Disseminate how they approach the problem, their mindset and understand it deeply, not just copying it,
- Travel the world. Be inspired by other culture, fetch data from other people
- Stay educated... Yeah, study variety of topics not just in your own field but others
- Take a walk. Just go, it is scientifically proven
