# Navigation Scheme
This is where we plan the navigation or locations that user could go. When we think about a shoping website, it is obvious that all e-commerce websites have their own home page.

Here, we think what could make the user's life easier, what do they want to access easily. When we think about it, we could guess that people wanted to access the items they have an eye on. Simply the saved items,

Another similar thing is the cart area where they saved items they are actually wanting to buy.

In this image, we erase the navigation bar and replace it by a button for actually ordering it. And also have an exit button if they don't want. Now, think about when user already order something, what do they want next? One thing is to track their orders. We may want to see the state of the items they bought so we creates another page for it. ![[Pasted image 20220716140726.png]]

Those are just the main parts of the navigation scheme, but how about the tiny parts where user could go, what are the things that user might want to go? Create a tree graph for those little things.

In the home page, people find itnered for an easy access to categories and interest. Also reviewing what they already bought. ![[Pasted image 20220716141038.png]]
