# Prototyping Basic
Is the next step after creating some [[Wireframe]]
We could do this in many ways but the easiest would be using [[Figma]]
First, go to the prototyping section, select the device and background color.

Select a frame

Then add the flow starting point

There are many interactions we could choose from.![[Pasted image 20220722050215.png]]

## While Hover
Interactin that triggers an event when the cursor enters a certain element. We could do it like this

Connect the arrows the the next page. ![[chrome-capture-2022-6-22.gif]]


## While Pressing
On the other hand, we do the same to the while pressing event, the only difference is that, this only triggers when we actually press the thing.

This is just using tap down and top up in a single event. Tap down will act when it is clicked and tap up will act when it is released from clicking.

## After Delay
Other wise, we could do it like this, I use a tap down method to make a certain image change fill, then after 100 mili seconds, we will do to the wishlist

Another advance prototyping technique is called [[Prototype Overlaying]]
