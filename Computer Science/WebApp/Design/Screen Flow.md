Is where we determine what will happen if we click a certain button.

When we press the search button, what will happen? If we press a result of the search button, the next screen to pop out is what?

The buttons we need to click is this in order to go to a certain page.

we also consider an alternate button to go to another component, like reversing the flow, but that is not the main focus, the *most important button should be the first thing that the user could notice*, the secondary buttons is harder to find than those main buttons.

Here, we also focus on what the user could see, not just the buttons. What are the things that the user might want to see? For example, items based on their preference, discount items, items stored into their cart etc. Then what will happen if we press those items?

We go to the same page as before, to the item detail compnent page. Now, we could notice the itnerrelationship of this pages more clearly than before.
