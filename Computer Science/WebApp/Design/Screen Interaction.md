# Screen Interaction
This is where we sketch some of the micro interaction and funcitonality to be considered, such as when we clicjk the search bar, what are the things to be overlayed? What are the buttons and what are their functionality. It overcross the [[Screen Flow]], screen interaction is a functionality that may or may not navigate a  user to other pages, but have a functionality that do micro stuff such as filtering, sorting, searching etc but

In our home page, we apply some buttons such as the heart shape that will save the item for later viewing. We also creae a carousel functionality where different items are scrolling automatically and manually in the page. Now, when we press the search button what will happen?![[Pasted image 20220716143637.png]]

Some overlay may occur, like keyboard rising, and we also implement auto suggest keywords dropping down in motion effects. Screen interaction is the part where we do some animation effects such as [[GSAP Timelines|timeline]] etc.![[Pasted image 20220716143921.png]]

Now, when we enter the search or pressed some autosggested keywords, it will bring us to the result panel.

we could imagine that pressing one of the components will deliver us to that item page.  Or we could save it to the cart or elsewhere.

we may need to apply filter on the result which we implemented using a top down effect motion.  with different types of filter like price, new items rviews etc, that the user may want to see
