# Sitemaps
These are diagrams that shows how pages are organized in heirarchical manner. We create this digrams at the start, after getting all the information about the product from the client. 

These are useful when making such thing as wireframes. It helps for a better understanding of how we could place strategically the pages so that user could easily access it. "I result into the creation of your navigation and heirarchies of your product."

## Anatomy of a Sitemap

The main 2  parts are tha *main card and the reference number*. The main card holds the title or label of the page and the reference numbers are used to refer the page in a wireframe. 

To create a sitemap, we start with the homepage.

This is how we may arrange it. From ground zero, to primary level to secondary level. Secondary level are labeled with decimal number. 

We could also use color coding to represent different restriction of each page

## 2 Types of Sitemaps
- Flat sitemaps - are used for smaller products, it have less vertical levels (2 levels) which is suitable for easily finding the pages needed by the user.

Here is an example of an actual sitemap

The home page contains a lot of details categorized using colors. In home, we could access the search, cart etc and we symbolize it using a box inside the main body.The reference number is optional so we don't necessarily need it. And branching our this are the possible pages we could access such as cetegories, deals, wishlist etc. We do the same in the seconadray pages also with features such as trending items or similar items in the cart or deals. 

Here is the format for the [sitemap](https://www.figma.com/file/cyrP6rSUFiHVEsIzSsX564/Sitemap-Resource?node-id=186%3A140) format used as well as the examples. The plugin used to create arrows is Autoflow inside the Figma app.

## Tips
- Think one problem at a time. If you are workign to build a sitemap, think only about the sitemap, nothing else
- Use your [[User Flows]] to create a sitemap. It will direct our focus to most important goals such as buying a product in an e commerce website.
- User colors. It is more attractive and memorable that way.
- Do not worry if your work is not finished, your could creae a [[User Flows]] and sitemap just for half a day then start creating wireframe, don't sweat the details as sitemaps is just a prelimenary steps of designing and we will polish that sooner. The sitemap won't answer us all things.


The next step after creating sitemaps are [[Wireframe]]
