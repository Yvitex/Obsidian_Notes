# Process Of Sketching
Sketching is the most fundamental, or the most basic part of design where we generate ideas as we could.

This consist of 2 kinds of process:
## Process of Sketching
The first part of sketching is *Idea generation* where we generate as much ideas as we could, we don't need to worry about complicated logics and errors as the second part of sketching is the *Detail refinement* where we focus on details, purge some ideas or add some ideas. 

And there are also the Process of Creating a Tangible Sketch.

After refining the ideas, we add more detalils by converting our ideas to a wireframe, after that, we thing about the components such as botton and inputs we implement to the component. 

# Flow Of Creating Sketch
Step 1: Prepare
	 *Prepare* - prepare your tools that you need, wether it is a paper or digital tools. 
	 *Know your Goals* - this will be our main focus
	 *Know your Audience* - if we are creating for others, we might want to be more detailed as possible
	 *Time limit* - Limit your time creating a sketch and focus

Step 2: Just fuckin go
	  *Draw A frame* - like a mobile phone or something that will hold our design
	  *Create the Redundant element* - like headers, navigation, footers.
	  *Create the detailed element* - like shapes, boxes, text. Some small information.
	  *Label your Sketch and save it* - make it detailed so that you can understand it even though you may not touch it for years
	  *Create more* - create an alternative, do not get satisfied. Improve
	  *Share your sketch* - have people make reviews, have client propose more ideas.

Step 3: Refinement
	*Add Title for the Sketch* - So that we could understand the relevant pieace of our sketch

  *Label More* - every pieces needs to be labeled so you know what you are looking at![[Pasted image 20220716103923.png]]
*User Numbers* - another label so that we could easily identify it as well as everybody else who could see it.

*Use Arrows* - It will help in describing events, what happens when we click this or this. Transitions and shits
