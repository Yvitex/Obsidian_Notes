# User Flows 
This is where we design the flow of experience of a user. From the home page, to the main page to the way the user exit the program, here we think about scenarios. For example, in e-commerce application, user will first go to the home page, then we identify or predict where user might want to go, like for example the search bar. Then ordering the product they choose until shipping process.

This may be the main flow, the main process of the product. But this is not the case for all users, we must provide an alternative way, for example, if the user cannot find the product they are looking for, then what must be displayed? Or when reading information about a certain product what information must we provide, like Reviews?

We must make the user happy, that's the point of creating this,

## Reflection
Before creating this, we must go into a proper mindset, we must ask ourselves this question:
- Do we want to create a large journey, or a small one?
- What point on the flow should we start? In the End? In the most critical part?
- What are  the next steps? Where should the user go? Where do we want the user to go?
- What options do the users have? What alternative flow must we provide?

## Layout
How can we create a meaningful user flow.
It should include description, step number and name.![[Pasted image 20220717055352.png]]
An example of a proper user flow is like this

To create this, we must know what is the glow of the particular flow? Who is doing it? and How do they do it?

The technical process of creating it requires us to *create a title that describes the goal*. The next is that the *process needs to be linear* and not too complex but also not too short, it doesn't go at multiple direction. And also *describe each step* to get to the goal.

The user flow must be the cleanest model of the design.

A deeper Level of this flow is called [[Screen Flow]] 

## Many Example

Separe each scenarious in a different frame, use [[Figma]] to make this flow easier.![[Pasted image 20220717110315.png]]

Don't get mistaken, we also need to create a flow when something goes wrong. Life what happen if we press the filter button etc, we think about different scenarios. We also think about where we implement an animation, for example. when user make a purchase, we may of think of this as rewarding the user with an animation.
