# Wireframe
Wireframes are like blueprints of products, this is where we create interactions and placements without worrying about typography or colors/ high fidelity designs. [[Sketching|product sketch]] amd [[Sitemap]] will influence this wireframes, but not completely as we could change some aspects of it. 

## Uses
- Helps you understand how users will navigate a product. Baiscally it is a [[User Flows]] but in a much more details
- We use them to learn as much as possible, it is fast to build and using it, we could fails as fast as possible. What this means is... we could easily points out the mistakes we have done by presenting it to others as wireframes are very fast to build, rather than creating high fidel designs.

We build, we measure what we build against something, if the users are interested in the product and learn from it and the build again implementing those designs.
- Clarity and understanding is one of the reason why to implement it, it will be the common ground, the common language for a common understanding between programmers. 
- Demo to clients for quick feedbacks about how we position the component, the layout, interaction, the flow, the heirarchy of things etc.


## Tips
- Keep them simple, don't stress the high quality design.
- You can polish them if you wanna present it to customers or clients
- Ask yourself some questions - what are the business goals when interacting a certain page? How can we arrange the component to support those goals? What should the user expect when they visit a ceertain area of the page?
- Consult your [[User Flows]] and [[Sitemap]], they are the bestindicators of what needs to be built in a certain page. For example. we may like the user to rate every page of the [[User Flows]] and they tackle the riskiest of them all
- Tackle the riskiest feature first, the most important that is inclined to the user goals must be the first to be solved. Or those things that the user are unsatisfied with.
- Talk to your team, go get their advice, fo talk to the experts.

## Examples

These are build using [[Figma]] and the resources above. Remember to do not settle in one design, make variations, research on the most effective design, ask people and clients. Also, there is this called Lorem Ipsum, down load it if you wanna. Also remember the component, use and resuse principle. Recyclable item needs to be recycled to speed up our designing process. 

Also, the highlignting options are just opacity difference, some of them have low opacity making them slightly grey.

The maximum font size used in this is 24px. Important text are bolded.

We reuse some components from the home screen, so may be the best programming frameworks we could use to contruct this is [[React]]
