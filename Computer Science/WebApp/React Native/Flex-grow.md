# Flex grow
This socifies the amount of growth of a flex container. `flex-grow: 1` will grow slower than `flex-grow: 2

`flex: 1` is simply a shortcut for `flex-grow: 1` `flex-shrink: 0`, `flex-basis: auto`

This means that it will grow the same proportion as the window screen. Very prominent in [[React Native]] programming when adaptngn into mobile view.
