# Which one is better?
[[Importing in Javascript]]
The common philosophy is, one file must export only one thing, which makes export default more compelling to use. But using named export also have its merits.

- We know what we are importing because the way we import it require us to know its name. 
- We could use arrow function. Well, not that we can't use it in export default.
- We could export multiple things... hehe.


We may like to use it when programming in [[React Native]]
