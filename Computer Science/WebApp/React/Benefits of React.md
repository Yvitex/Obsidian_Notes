# What does React do
Simply [[DOM]] manipulation. [[React]] updates components depending on the state of things, depending on the condition asked, react already knows what to do and what to update.

We do not need to use [[Javascript]]'s way to getting an element from an [[HTML]], like when
```js
document.getElementById()
```

Or even
```js
document.querySelector()
```

We simply creates an [[HTML]] file inside [[Javascript]] and voila, we have already a website. With this, it will reduce the time it takes to create front end design.
