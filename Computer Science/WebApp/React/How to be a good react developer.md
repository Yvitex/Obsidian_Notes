In [[React]], we must first understand the things that make it great such as:
- It is a declarative programming
- Unidirectional data flow
- Use of [[React Component]]
- Only for the [[User Interface Basics|UI]]


## Better React Dev
- First is to decide on the [[React Component]]
- Second is to decide on the states to use and where it lives
- Understand what changes and when it will change
