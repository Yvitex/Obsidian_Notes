1. Use [[HTTP Request Verbs]]:
- [[Restful Api Architecture GET|get]] - (read) - 
-[[Restful Api Architecture Post|post]] - (create) -
- [[Restful Api Architecture Put|put]]- (update) - creating an entire entry to replace the previous ones.
-  [[Restful Api Architecture Patch|patch]]- (update) - updating only a certain part of the data
- [[Restful Api Architecture Delete|delete]] - (delete) -
 
2. Use specific pattern of Routes/ Endpoint URLs - simply organizing your routes.
